      "Key Findings": "The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, it examines the approach to foreign aid being used in South Sudan, which reflects the new thinking in providing assistance to post-conflict countries. The United States Agency for Intemational Development (USAID) adopted the extensive empirical work by Collier, Hoeffler, and Soderbom' in its policy and program guide to economic\ngrowth in post-conflict countries. Second, by building upon this new approach the paper suggests how foreign aid can mitigate the risk of violent conflict recurring in the newly independent South Sudan. It explores strategies for growth and development by encouraging the private sector to take the lead in addressing key impediments to business development, trade, and investment. ",

      "Key Findings": "Public Private Cooperation (PPC) has proved to be effective at the U.S. Department of State and U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). Department of Defense leaders are expressing interest in implementing parallel approaches. PPC is intended to further policy objectives, enhance U.S. operational capabilities, reduce costs, gain access to nonmilitary expertise or assets, or build greater capacity in partners. As DOD adapts to meet evolving roles and missions in an unpredictable and complex world amid fiscal constraints, the expertise and involvement of the private sector, including nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), research institutions, and academia will be essential. ",
      "Key Recommendations": "This paper proposes broad recommendations to help provide a framework for the future of PPC in DOD. \n\nThe Defense Department needs to pay more attention to PPC, clarify authorities, and allocate appropriate resources. Incremental changes could bring benefits now, but systemic solutions will be needed for DOD to implement PPC on the scale that will be required to meet the evolving demands of the new strategic environment.  These significant steps could center on policy and doctrine, organization, training and education, and congressional support. ",

      "Key Findings": "We identified legitimation work as occurring across objects, audiences, and time. Thus, we introduce legitimation work as the purposeful effort of the legitimacy seeker to avoid certain issues while ensuring other issues that are of importance to the conferrer of legitimacy. These findings contribute to micro-level considerations within institutional theory which view legitimacy as socially constructed between legitimacy seeker and conferrer. Hence, we add another perspective on legitimation to the previously existing conceptualizations of legitimacy as a deterministic consequence of institutionalization.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Further investigations are necessary to sharpen our understanding of legitimation work. Possible research questions include whether the two dimensions of legitimation work, namely avoiding and ensuring, are substitutes, mutually enforcing, additive, or independent from each other. In connection to that, another question is whether the dimensions constitute necessary or sufficient aspects of legitimation work.",

      "Key Findings": "Defining DoD’s role in using humanitarian health programs for security goals can and should be done. I propose such a definition, but only to begin discussion. Equally important is the implementation of scientific evaluation of humanitarian missions. This can be done quickly, without new authorization or appropriation legislation. Then DoD can get on with the business of national security, using the humanitarian response tool in the most effective ways. For DoD to avoid this “easier service” trap in its humanitarian efforts, we must be clear in our intentions, sustainable in our actions, and compulsively thorough in our evaluations. Together, even in the face of a tenuous link between health interventions and peace outcomes, DoD can deliver on its peace and security mandate to the taxpayers and the Congress",
      "Key Recommendations": "I believe there are potential solutions for the challenges of validating DoD’s engagement in humanitarian work for security objectives. There are two essential ingredients: DoD must first define exactly what it hopes to accomplish. Second, DoD should monitor and evaluate its efforts with greater rigor. ",

      "Key Findings": "U.S. agencies have sought to address causes of unaccompanied alien child (UAC) migration through recent programs, such as information campaigns to deter migration, developed in response to the migration increase and other long-standing efforts. The recent migration increase was likely triggered, according to U.S. officials, by several emergent factors such as the increased presence and sophistication of human smugglers (known as coyotes) and confusion over U.S. immigration policy. Officials also noted that certain persistent conditions such as violence and poverty have worsened in certain countries. In addition to long-standing efforts, such as U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) antipoverty programs, agencies have taken new actions. For example, Department of Homeland Security (DHS)-led investigative units have increasingly sought to disrupt human smuggling operations.",
      "Key Recommendations": "GAO recommends that DHS and State take steps to integrate evaluations into their planning for, and implementation of, future information campaigns intended to deter migration. GAO also recommends that DHS establish performance targets for its investigative units. DHS concurred with both recommendations, and State concurred with the one recommendation directed to it.",

      "Key Recommendations": "As a recommendation we can define the importance of having in writing a permanent linkage strategy between the technical staff of the private non-sponsorship project and the ADP facilitator, in future interventions, in order to complement actions that will contribute to positioning the work carried out by the organizations in the HEA permanent programmes.\n\nAdditionally, it is recommended that WV and the CODEM prepare a transition and follow-up plan to the activities involving the MNIGR and CODEL in order to ensure proper monitoring, taking into account the achievements of the project and the challenges that remain after the project’s intervention. \n\nEspecially in the creation of action protocols between municipal structures, Regional N°6 from COPECO, MNIGR and private sector to ensure that proper and efficient response is being given when an emergency or disaster happens in the urban context.",

      "Key Findings": "• Resilience is a social and political issue as much as an economic and developmental one. Efforts to “build back better” must also incorporate support for Nepal’s political transition as a foundation for resilience. \n• Strengthening pre-established partnerships between the public and private sectors can improve responses to and reduce the impacts of future emergencies. \n• Crucial economic sectors, such as tourism and construction, can benefit from public-private cooperation for recovery and reconstruction. – Implementing and enforcing building codes and focusing on making schools safe should be a high priority in reconstruction efforts. \n• Retrofitting to make existing houses more “earthquake- resilient” can save lives and reduce economic losses, and can be done in an affordable way that uses locally available skills and technologies. \n• The private sector can offer unique expertise, capability and capacity for the Nepali government’s reconstruction efforts. \n• Public-private partnerships and innovative financing arrangements can be crucial parts of reconstruction and building resilience in Nepal.\n",

      "Key Findings": "This paper has six sections. Section I presents an overview of key findings and recommendations. Section II paints a picture of an effective 21st century U.S. development function. Section III provides a brief history of aid reform and sets out the principles upon which the paper is based. Section IV identifies elements of the current aid reform agenda that merit continued cultivation. Section V sets forth additional ideas for further action. Section VI outlines the need in the future for a mutual cooperation and partnering approach for U.S. global engagement as assistance declines as a source of development solutions.\n\nThe recommendations following each narrative generally are tiered in order of importance and impact, but not always. Certain suggestions serve as alternative options. This paper deals mainly with the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), which, as the principal U.S. development agency, has been at the center of the aid reform agenda. Other U.S. government agencies are brought into the analysis where they are relevant to specific issues.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Recommendations:\n• One-stop-shop: Business has long complained about having to go to multiple U.S. government agencies to find the one program that might support its interests and the slowness in working through the bureaucratic maze to get an answer, even a “no.” Power Africa reportedly has made interagency collaboration work—hosting multiple agencies at the same meeting with a U.S. company facilitates quick identification of which agencies might support the company’s planned project. This experience should be built upon to create a formal one-stop-shop, both online and a staffed office, for business looking for engagement with U.S. foreign affairs agencies, as would be authorized by S.3227, the Economic Growth and Development Act, introduced by Senator Johnny Isakson.\n• Comprehensive interagency engagement package: Short of a one-stop-shop, again building on the experience of Power Africa, a strategy and interagency capability should be created to provide an integrated business engagement package of support involving USAID, Department of State, USDA, OPIC, USTDA, Export-Import Bank, and the Commerce Department so as to provide comprehensive support for engaging U.S. companies in development activities.\n• Evaluation of PPPs: A formal assessment of USAID’s PPPs should be undertaken, both as a mechanism for engaging the private sector and as a way to produce development results. Assess the impact of PPPs, the sustainability of results, the measurement of outcomes, and the value of the GDA model, including whether the 1:1 finance match requirement is beneficial or a distraction. Analyze the roles of commercial interest and shared value in a partnership to determine whether they are key indicators of the likelihood of sustainability and should serve as filters in assessing prospective partnerships. Review the role and value of dedicated relationship managers and whether they should be full-time positions.\n• Strategic engagement: Using the experience of the BAA, assess how to better engage the private sector in strategic discussions in the design phase of programs and policies.",

      "Document Title": "Private Sector Partnerships: Achieving Enduring Results",
      "Key Findings": "• Market-oriented activities conducted either by partners or by beneficiaries have a higher likelihood of enduring than non-market-oriented partnerships.\n• PPPs designed around a core business opportunity for a profit-driven partner have a high likelihood of creating enduring results.\n• By contrast, partnerships with profit-seeking partners engaging in CSR activities that are not linked to their core business – whether market- oriented or non-market-oriented – are less likely to achieve sustainability. \n• The private sector played a critical role in nine partnerships of the eleven that sustained and scaled.\n• Private sector relationships are most additive as an asset when used to create market linkages.\n• Not surprisingly, of the six instances where the private sector actor could have been any type of actor, our did not sustain.\n• Policy change can be particularly effective when combining private sector assets with government capabilities.\n• Capacity-building produces enduring results only in conjunction with a different pathway to sustainability.\n• Partnerships that achieve policy change demonstrate strong potential to both sustain and scale, without requiring additional funding.\n• Partnerships with corporations that have a strong local presence are more likely to have results that are financially self-sustaining.\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. Intentionally pursue more market-oriented partnerships with\nprivate sector partners. These partnerships should provide critical additionality (ideally through the relationships and/or specialized capabilities of private sector partners) and chart a clear path to sustainability and scale at the outset.\n2. Strengthen USAID practitioners’ and partners’ understanding of expectations for sustainability and scale in USAID’s PPPs.\n3. Modify internal partnership data collection and/or analysis to track sustainability and scale outcomes.\n4. Promote knowledge sharing and peer-to-peer learning on partnership sustainability.\n5. Incorporate key success factors for market-oriented pathways to achieve sustainability and scale.\n6. Ensure continuity of people involved or the transfer of key information in design and especially implementation.\n7. Build checkpoints on sustainability into ongoing partnership processes – and course-correct as needed.\n8. Be intentional about scale during planning and implementation.\n9. Gather insights on implementation by incorporating select metrics into the annual data collection cycle and/or partnership health surveys that are conducted periodically.\n10. Incentivize midterm reporting on progress toward goals for sustainability and scale.\n11. Set expectations for ex-post reporting.\n12. Create incentives for ex-post reporting.\n",

PPP has a long history in developed countries, but the approach has only recently gained attention as a method for boosting economic growth and development in developing countries. The article argues that the companies‘ motivation for participating in PPP in Somalia extends beyond the conventional objective of commercial considerations to the moral imperative of supporting members of the umma (community), despite considerable risks, and is at the forefront of Turkey‘s interest in Africa.",

      "Key Findings": "The United States National Preparedness System has evolved significantly in the recent past. These changes have affected the system structures and goals for disaster response. At the same time, actors such as private businesses have become increasingly involved in disaster efforts. In this paper, we begin to fill the gap in the cross-sector literature regarding interactions that have systemic impacts by investigating how the simultaneous processes of systemic change and intensifying cross-sector interaction worked and interacted in the context of the preparedness system. We examine these inter-linkages through a qualitative study in the setting of Hurricane Sandy. Drawing from systems theory, we develop a grounded model that provides an explanation for the system change and highlights how cross-sector interaction relates to the changes observed in the system.",

      "Document Title": "Global Public–Private Partnerships and the New Constitutionalism of the Refugee Regime",
      "Key Findings": "Since the early 2000s, regimes and institutions of global governance have undergone a paradigmatic shift in their relations with multinational corporations. The United Nations, in particular, has increasingly embraced big business as ‘partner’ in humanitarian response and development with the establishment of ‘global public private partnerships’ (GP3s). This article situates this emerging mode of global governance within the recent academic discussions on Global Constitutionalism from a critical political economy perspective, focusing on the case of the UN Refugee Agency’s GP3s in refugee protection and assistance. Critically inquiring into GP3s not only as informal global constitutional arrangements but also as a set of political relations, this article asks: what is the constitutional and political nature of UNHCR– business partnerships? What impacts, if any, do they have on the agency? And, what does this mean for understanding global constitutionalism? The article argues that UNHCR partnerships are constituted as asymmetrical political relations in terms of their distributions of power, benefits, risks and commitments, that they are having neoliberal-oriented constitutive effects on the agency and that these constitutional dynamics challenge the more mainstream and liberal-based conceptualisations, analyses and promotion of current global constitutionalism processes.",
