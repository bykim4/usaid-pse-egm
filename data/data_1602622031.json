      "Key Recommendations": "In outlining plans for strategic transitions, USAID should seek to draw lessons from its own history and that of other bilateral donors.\n\nAmong the most critical factors USAID will need to consider are the length of the timeframe afforded to the transition process—a minimum of three to five years is crucial for guarding development gains—and the need to set clear objectives and tasks as part of a\ntransition strategy.\n\nCoordination has also proven important to the success of past transitions.\n\nWhile USAID should be sure to consider options short of complete exit, as part of any transition planning, the agency will need to evaluate threats to sustaining results achieved with help from past USAID investments and to incorporate plans to mitigate such risks.\n\nFinally, USAID can help ensure its own success—as it looks to reshape partnerships well into the future—by transparently monitoring its transition process and capturing any lessons learned.",

Human capacity building in leadership, organizational development and finance at all levels and across all sectors is needed and was requested by ministries, steering committees, institutions, universities, NGOs and Disabled People’s Organization (DPOs).\n\nThe recently granted legal status and recognition of DPOs present an opportunity to improve the involvement of PWD in advocating for resources and full inclusion in society. Equitable access to services and opportunities continues to be a challenge despite improved laws and policies. The lack of monitoring and evaluation in all facets of the sector is negatively affecting thepotential impact of programs and initiatives.",
      "Key Recommendations": " The soon to be issued Inclusive Education 2015 from MOET requires technical assistance at\nmany levels if it is to be successful.\n Decrease any duplication of efforts with social work training by creating opportunities for\ncollaboration between VNAH and San Jose University/CISCO projects.\n Strengthen NCCD’s coordination role and advocate for its elevation to the national committee.\n Strengthen MOLISA’s ability to enforce the disability law and policies.\n The departure of Atlantic Philanthropies by 2015 will present a gap in support to mental health.",

      "Key Findings": "How has the last five years of investment in the MRP \"moved the dial\" on attitudes toward and abilities for achieving sustainability in fisheries management? \nMMAF’s draft RENSTRA marks a significant shift in the Ministry’s commitment for and approach to sustainable capture fisheries, as compared to earlier strategies. MMAF requested technical assistance from IMACS to provide technical advice on RENSTRA recommendations to promote sustainable capture fisheries and aquaculture. To this end, IMACS developed an Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) Fishing dashboard to estimate economic loss from illegal fishing practices. The dashboard development marks an effective partnership between IMACS and the MMAF to ensure the sustainability of Indonesia’s fisheries. IMACS also supported the MMAF’s efforts to develop a long-term strategic view for capture fisheries and aquaculture, beyond the RENSTRA’s 5-year timespan.\nA second example is the implementation of a Fisheries Management Plan (FMP) for Fisheries Management Area (Wilayah Pengelolaan Perikanan, WPP) 718 in the Arafura Sea. The FMP illustrates the GOI’s commitment to sustainable capture fisheries, achieved through an Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries Management (EAFM). The MRP was a crucial resource during the development of the WPP 718 FMP and provided best-practice models for key MMAF staff.\n\nWhat can we learn about building the national government’s capacity to provide technical training by comparing the different approaches implemented according to the MRP? \nA collaborative and integrative approach for training leads to more effective program implementation, compared with a consultative training approach. Although the MRP included capacity building activities at the national and regional levels and covered a wide range of topics for diverse target audiences, the internalization of training content within the MMAF remains  incomplete. Increased knowledge and enhanced skills, supported by an\nintegrated program, will deepen key capacities and should be a priority for future programming.\n\nA variety of approaches to capacity building were employed by MRP partners, and the MPAG approach was found to be the most successful. The MPAG prioritized local resources and empowering stakeholders, including experts hired by the key NGO consortium to assist the MMAF DG with regional and national MPAG implementation. IMACS’s deployment of distance consultancy support to compensate for a lack of national-level stakeholders was found to be ineffective. Furthermore, at the regional level, staff lacked sufficient authority as decision-makers and, therefore, functioned primarily as officers. The NOAA-IAA’s lack of provisions to hire local experts challenged their capacity to facilitate project activities. \n\nHow have the last five years of investment in the MRP strengthened the enabling institutional conditions needed to implement an effective national system of MPAs? \nMRP investment in strengthening an effective national system of MPAs has been perceived as a valuable contribution by MMAF. The MPAG supported the establishment of eight MPAs covering nearly five million hectares. 16 out of 20 million hectares throughout Indonesia have s been established as MPAs. Furthermore, MMAF acknowledged Technical Guidelines for Evaluating the Management Effectiveness of Aquatic, Coastal, and Small Island Conservation Areas (Evaluasi Efektifitas Pengelolaan Kawasan Konservasi Pesisir dan\nPulau-pulau Kecil, E-KKP3K) and seven guidebooks and decision support systems (DSS), prepared as part of the MRP. Finally, six MPAs were evaluated using the E-KKP3K tool.\n\nThe existence of an E-KKP3K tool provides a strong foundation to evaluate and improve MPA management and development in the future. The new decree issued with MRP support on standard competences (SK3) has set a new standard/benchmark for MPA managers in enabling MMAF institution to better manage MPA development. However, the effectiveness of executing this competency standard will depend on the supporting institutional working mechanism within the relevant national and local authorities. Although the MRP has supported the development of eight MPAs, the framework for a sustainable financing mechanism to support the MPA’s future development still needs to be institutionalized at the national and local levels with potential support from outside funding.\n\nWhat can we learn about the status and trends of MPA Management Effectiveness in Indonesia from the work of MRP?\nOut of the eight major MPAs supported by the MPAG program, only Nusa Penida has produced quantitative data to show program implementation achievements and outcomes. Elsewhere, monitoring data is limited. An assessment of the impact of the MPAG initiative on biodiversity in Nusa Penida MPA, of which MPAG was the primary funding source during the period in question, reveals an increase in coral cover and fish abundance in the MPA (see page 38).\n\nThe use of the E-KKP3K assessment tool to assess MPA management effectiveness has been a valuable process. More than 20 sites were assessed during Year 1, in order to establish a baseline and track improvements through to Year 3. The assessment shows significant improvements in the conservation areas’ management status across the main 8 MPAs supported by the MPAG program. The most significant achievement was noted in the Aquatic National Park, Savu Sea, where management status improved from level of Yellow to Green and, finally, Blue between the years 2012 and 2014. In total, MPAs supported by the MPAG initiatives account for nearly five million hectares, or more than\none third of the total MPA area.\n\nGiven the lessons learned through this analysis, key changes in the institutional arrangements for coastal management in Indonesia, and the current political climate, what opportunities and risks should USAID have in mind as we implement our next coastal-marine project?\nThe WPPs established by the MMAF are crucial for the sustainability of capture fisheries. The FMP established for WPP 718 in the Arafura Sea, for which the MRP has provided critical assistance, is a pioneer case study for the future of the EAFM in Indonesia. The development and approach process for the WPP 718 FMP informed the development of\nthe other ten FMPs. These were submitted to the MMAF for enactments in July 2015.",
      "Key Recommendations": "KEY RECOMMENDATIONS\nHow have the last 5 years of investment in the MRP \"moved the dial\" on attitudes toward and abilities for achieving sustainability in fisheries management?\nThe MMAF has recognized the importance of IMACS’s support to facilitate and enrich its new strategic direction. IMACS’s support for the development of the RENSTRA marks an important step towards ensuring sustainable fisheries management. However, future\nmarine programs should also utilize the RENSTRA as a point of reference for program development. Therefore, a joint or integrated work plan between the USAID and MMAF should be taken into account.\n2. USAID is advised to build upon initial investments to assist the MMAF with the Arafura WPP 718 FMP by providing further support for refinement and implementation, including more effective management of fisheries efforts, illegal fishing abatement, stakeholder socialization, the development of individual stock management plans for constituent\nfisheries, and the development of additional FMPs. All such activities should be implemented in concurrence with WPP FMP execution.\nSOW QUESTION 1. THEME 2. What can we learn about building the national\ngovernment’s capacity to provide technical trainings by comparing the different\napproaches implemented in the MRP?\n1. The development of an integrated strategy with key partners in the early stage of program\nimplementation will improve effectiveness and avoid confusion within an institution where\ndifferent mechanisms operate simultaneously for capacity building. The strategy should\nidentify the respective roles of each partner and establish a system for collaboration.\n2. Out of several approaches to capacity building, the MPAG approach was the most\nappreciated by both MMAF and DKP staff, and should be taken as a model for future\ninterventions. Though lacking a fully integrated approach, IMACS’s work on the\ndevelopment of the Indonesia Climate Adaptation Tool for Coastal Habitats (I-CATCH),\nIndonesia Fisheries Information System (I-Fish), FMPs, WPPs, and the draft RENSTRA\nwere deemed to be valuable contributions. A future MRP should prioritize program\nintegration beginning in the early planning stages, in order to ensure consistency and avoid\nconfusion between partners.\n3. Provisions must be made for flexibility and adjustments to planned activities and program\nimplementation, due to changing political dynamics and bureaucracy. This will help to\nensure the achievement of program objectives.\n1. SOW QUESTION 2. THEME 3. How have the last 5 years of investment in\nMRP strengthened the enabling institutional conditions needed to\nimplement an effective national system of MPAs? In order to achieve the total\ntarget expansion of MPAs to 20 million hectares by 2020, USAID should continue to\nwork together with the MMAF. MPA manager capacity building will constitute one of\nthe strategic investments for USAID.\n2. The MPAG’s collaborative approach in working with the MMAF and other NGO\npartners to identify and support the MMAF’s fisheries sustainability and conservation\nagendas may be considered an example of best-practice for institutional partnerships.\nThis approach should be undertaken and further strengthened in future programs, as\noutlined in the RENSTRA 2015-2019.\n3. As of the close of this program in 2015, a total of eight MPAs have received MRP\nsupport, while an additional 16 have been identified as priorities for future projects. The\nprovision of USAID assistance to develop a framework for sustainable financing for\nfuture MPAs, institutionalized at the national and local levels, will help to ensure future\nMPA development.\nSOW QUESTION 2. THEME 4. What can we learn about the status and trends of\nMPA management effectiveness in Indonesia from the work of MRP?\n1. The next marine project should take into account institutional governance and\ncoordination schemes, as exhibited in the Multi-Stakeholder Forum for MPA\nManagement in Gili Matra (a national MPA) and Nusa Penida (a district MPA), in order\nto achieve successful program implementation.\n2. Future MPA-support projects should include appropriate monitoring and evaluation of\nbiophysical indicators to enable an understanding of project impacts.\n3. The USAID’s next program strategy should closely integrate fisheries management with\ncoastal biodiversity conservation efforts. This will provide favorable conditions for\nenabling fisheries management to create multiplier effects for coastal biodiversity and\nsustainable livelihoods.\nSOW QUESTIONS 3. THEME 5. Given the lessons learned through this analysis,\nkey changes in the institutional arrangements for coastal management in\nIndonesia, and the current political climate, what opportunities and risks should\nUSAID have in mind as we implement our next coastal-marine project?\n1. In relation to new local autonomy laws (UU No 23 of 2014, j/o UU 9/2015), the next\nUSAID marine project should consider the integration and knowledge transfer of coastal\nmanagement initiatives at the regency level to the Provincial Government. USAID\nshould support further support institutional arrangements in the Provincial Government\nto strengthen their role in coastal management development.\n2. The E-KKP3K assessment tool and the Seven Guide books on MPA management and\ndevelopment, produced by MMAF with assistance from MPAG, should be more widely\ndisseminated within MMAF, the Ministry of Forestry and Environment, and the regional\nlevel for the protection of coastal biodiversity. This will build up a sense of ownership\nfor the management of MPAs at the local level and help to ensure the sustainability of\ninitiatives.\n3. In regard to the small grants program for coastal communities, the next USAID project\nshould consider shifting away from supporting many individual pilots to a more focused\napproach that is better aligned with program priorities, monitored closely, and better\nsupported and sustained by being effectively embedded within a broader supportive\ninstitutional context.",

      "Document Title": "Final Performance Evaluation and Sustainability Assessment of the Building Livelihoods and Trade (BLT) Activity",
      "Key Findings": "• Livelihoods \nFrom TMI almost 20 percent of graduates progress to university or further study – mostly observed among calligraphy graduates. In recognition of their skills and aptitude, the graduates from the calligraphy specialization are, normally, exempted from the first year of study for a Fine Arts degree at Kabul University  Just over half of the graduates remain in craft trades; many of the graduates work in fledgling businesses that are heavily reliant upon TM for support.  Through its wider activities in sector, TM has achieved $3.5 million of craft export sales on behalf of Afghan artisans and businesses, which did not exist before the project commenced its work. \n\n• Trade The TM business development department is currently working with 20 businesses – many in Murad Khane area.  Of these 20 businesses, 11 are government-registered, and 12 have been operating for two years or less.  The brand recognition and reputation of the TM name is successful in generating prestigious large one-off bespoke orders, e.g. a Saudi hotel commission; and repeat bulk orders from ethical traders in North America – e.g., Far and Wide and Bajalia jewelers. Typically, the orders for the international market are sourced by TM from businesses that are able to produce goods of the required quality. Overall TM has supported 15 businesses to export.\n\n• Quality\n TM has demonstrated its capacity to fulfill orders with a consistency and quality that meet the demands of the international market.  Quality of the product is often achieved at the expense of diversity of supply – only a relatively small number of craft (mostly jewelry) businesses in Afghanistan regularly work with TM to fulfill orders for the international market.  The quality of the TM graduates is generally mixed – it is reported that, although some have excellent craft skills, many graduates lack job-ready skills, business awareness, English-language skills, and computer literacy. \n\n• Rehabilitation\n TM transformed Murad Khane from a wasteland into an historical treasure.  The health and education services established by TM are highly valued by the community.  TM provided electricity supply, water pipes, and sanitation for residents, cleared and leveled the streets, and removed thousands of cubic meters of refuse and accumulated detritus from the area.  Residents noted that the water infrastructure is no longer functional and they have concerns about the maintenance of their homes and the communal drainage system. While TM accepts responsibility for cleaning the draining system and assisting with particular large repairs, it does not accept responsibility for other work.  About a quarter of families interviewed complained that TM works for those who have connections with the right people. TM clarified that they are not making promises of assistance; at a minimum, the evaluation team believes that these community responses point to some miscommunication. \n\n• Cost \nThe unit cost of TM training is currently very high: more than $20,000 per graduate for the three-year program.  The current cost base at TMI is unsustainable; staffing levels are high; training is inconsistent and not always of high quality, even in the specialist craft areas; three years of full-time study is too long and not suited to the requirements of many craft trades; and the awarding of a stipend to students, while being an excellent pro-poor policy, has not always been justifiable since several young people have been incentivized to study at TMI in the absence of any particular interest, ambition, or aptitude in handicrafts  An apprenticeship scheme with part-time attendance at TMI would be welcomed by the trades and the companies that the evaluation team consulted. \n\n• Gender \nAs almost all similar endeavors in Afghanistan, the BLT project has benefitted more male artisans and businesspeople than female artisans and business people. The evaluation team focused on the extent to which women participated and benefitted from the project.  TMI has, for the most part, been careful in its recruitment to maintain a female student population of at least 25 percent, though currently the proportion has fallen to below 20 percent. Women are concentrated in calligraphy, with several in jewelry but few women in the other trades and crafts.  There are eight female staff out of 57 TMI employees; five are teachers.  A small number of notably successful female businesses have been founded, e.g., Samira Kitman and her Muftah-e-Hunar Foundation (since 2010); and fledgling jewelry companies that are nurtured under the wing of TM. Independence from Donor Support Projections show TMI to be self-sustaining, funded by endowment / drawdown funding for at least the next ten years.  The current high cost base at TMI means that cost reduction measures must be implemented to ensure the viability of these sustainability projections.  TMI has the potential to be a ‘profit’ rather than a ‘cost’ center and thereby be in a stronger position to ensure sustainability after five-to-ten years.  Growth figures showing income generation from international sales require big capacity expansion from the supply chain.\n\n• Sustainable Public-Private Partnerships\nTM has built successful commercial relationships with several ethical traders in the UK and US, e.g., Kate Spade and Bajalia, and repeat orders are forthcoming.  Turquoise Mountain has developed a strong brand and reputation. It has collaborated on discrete projects with other companies in the sector, but its relationships with the Afghan government agencies responsible for international trade are less well-developed. Ambitious plans for a sector-wide ‘Brand Afghanistan’ are in their early stages of formulation.  The potential for developing PPPs through TM is evident from their past performance; TM has a strong track record in generating and increasing sales for the craft sector, with demonstrable year on year growth. \n\n• Viable Independent Businesses and Quality Jobs  \nA small number of enterprises with which TM collaborates are strongly business-savvy.  TM supports fledgling businesses (currently 20, both male and female), seven of which are, at the moment, in its ‘business incubator’ operation.  TM graduates’ business-ready skills are, though, somewhat weak.  The majority of international sales are brokered by TM, but 88 percent of TMI graduates find access to local markets without the intervention of TM\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "• The Board of Trustees (BOT) should conduct a thorough review of the quality of the programs and activities at the TMI so that they are delivered to the highest standard and in the most cost-effective manner, and so the skills of the graduates are more closely aligned to labor market needs. The review needs to assess the viability of TMI as a\nmixed-economy learning establishment with, for example, full- and part-time craft programs; short course delivery to businesses and the local community; postgraduate research; and international collaboration with vocational colleges, universities, and institutes of higher education.\n\n• The management at TMT and the BOT must ensure that ambitious plans for the commercial developments of the Trust, with the formation of an independent for-profit trading arm, do not become a distraction to the core purpose and principles upon which TMT was founded. In particular, TMI should be kept under constant scrutiny and review\nto ensure that the courses are suitable to prevailing market conditions, are of high quality, and are aligned to students’ and employers’ needs.\n\n• On the basis of TM’s declared aim to build a strong Afghan brand through internationa market recognition, the management should work with other NGOs and local Afghan agencies to play a greater role, collectively, in the quality assurance and collaborative marketing of the products of ‘Brand Afghanistan.’ TM is well-placed, through its reputation and independence, to authenticate and verify many of the indigenous arts and craft products and, in particular, gemstones. The formation of an independent laboratory for gemstone and materials testing and verification is an example of one tangible way in which TM could use its good offices for the greater good of Afghanistan trade.\n\n• TM should re-examine relationships and communication with the Murad Khane community, keeping in mind that the community is not static. Periodic efforts to update the community – both men and women – are important to containing the spread of misinformation and managing expectations. At the same time, it may be worth examining\nwhether favoritism affects relationships with the community and how it can be curtailed. TM might consider additional monitoring methods to ensure that resources are being fairly distributed.\n\n• TM should consider working with the community to draft written responsibilities so that it is clear what the institute will do to assist with the maintenance of structures, garbage collection, drainage, and other essential services, and for what the community and/or shura is responsible. Consulting the Ministry of Culture and Information in the process is also advised, as it currently has responsibility for historical city preservation.\n",

      "Document Title": "USAID/India Health of the Urban Poor Program Final Evaluation Report",
      "Key Findings": "• Progress against mid-term recommendations:\nFindings: TA: HUP created state-level preparedness for the NUHM launch and developed a comprehensive primary health service framework. It realized the potential matrix delineated by the MTE, except for addressing intra-health coordination. However, the post-NUHM potential for an integrated and convergent urban health model—one which delineates the role of each stakeholder and the funding source for each planned intervention—could not be found in any state. HUP could not overcome the disinclination and the nascent capacities of the states to innovate beyond the NUHM guidelines. Private Public Partnerships (PPP): HUP could not move forward on the PPPs in the absence of interest within the governments to participate. The importance of the missed opportunity to build on what previously existed within the governments is now clear in light of the barriers being faced by the NUHM to recruit and retain health functionaries in the urban areas. Convergence: HUP facilitated the creation of convergent platforms. HUP incorporated water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) indicators into its monitoring plans and successfully integrated WASH components with the country’s supplementary nutrition program. There has been ample progress and realized outcomes on integration, as reflected by the WASH interventions in the Project Implementation Plans (PIP) of seven states. The coordination with other programs and stakeholders has however been minimal, limited to invitations to advocacy and dissemination workshops. Demonstration sites: HUP has systematically documented the capacity of state and municipal urban health systems, tracked beneficiary level indicators, and is in the process of completing the endline survey as recommended by the MTE. Although several research studies were carried out by HUP, operational research to determine meaningful Mahila Aarogya Samitis (MAS) incentives and impact assessment of demonstration sites have not been carried out.\n\n• Effectiveness of Scale-up Approaches\nFindings: Four of the five scale-up approaches have been incorporated into the NUHM framework. These include formation of women’s groups (MAS) at the community level, implementation of urban health and nutrition days (UHND), city health planning (CHP), and establishment of city coordination committees (CCC) as convergent platforms for implementing the NUHM. Similar structures at the ward level, the Ward Coordination Committees (WCC), were not adopted by the NUHM. The fifth approach, the Health Management Information System (HMIS), though customized for all eight HUP states has not been streamlined at the national level and disaggregated data for urban slums is not being collated and analyzed by the NUHM. In all, 4,267 (58% of target) MAS were formed, 118,148 (97%) UHNDs were held, eight (61%) CCCs were formed and 379 (1895%) CHPs were developed. \n\n• Effectiveness of Convergence\nFindings: HUP has facilitated the delineation of convergence processes, advocated for convergent platforms, and supported the formation of convergence structures at the state and city level. The convergence efforts of HUP resulted in WASH practices being adopted by the Health and Women and Child Development Departments. The model of point of use (POU) water testing and treatment developed by HUP has been adopted in seven states. Although the convergent actions were evidently strong at the community and the ward level (in the few locations where WCCs have been formed), there is an overall perception among the stakeholders that convergence has been initiated but not achieved at state and city level. HUP’s efforts to facilitate convergence with other urban development initiatives were limited.\n\n• Extent of policy influence\nFindings: The evaluation found that HUP’s TA has led to outcomes that include demonstration sites that informed the NUHM framework, advocacy that created an enabling environment for urban health, replication and scale up of urban health programming, a demand for TA, a high level of appreciation for the TA among HUP states, and increased allocation (122%) of funds to urban health. However, the evaluation also found that sustainable capacities are yet to be achieved at the state level. The challenges to influencing policy have been the states’ limited readiness, their low level of interest in urban programming, the short period of implementation, and the delayed launch of NUHM at the state level.\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "Recommendations for USAID\n1. Design a convergence mechanism such as pooled funding from USAID sources for programs seeking to address cross-cutting health issues which require multi-sectoral approaches and recruit regional hubs of high-powered TA teams, as opposed to central TA teams for such programs. Complement these teams with a small hand-holding team at the state level. Rationalize team size based on a preparedness analysis of states when introducing newer strategies or interventions to ensure ownership and results. \n2. Invest in documenting and disseminating HUP lessons, products, and models to reach a wider set of audience (state governments, non-health departments involved in urban development, organizations working with marginalized population, donors and other countries in the process of strengthening urban health programs). Important among the lessons that must be disseminated include: participation of men in urban health, convergence processes, and the need for a comprehensive urban health model. Some suggested avenues for dissemination are national and international conferences, regional workshops for disseminating process documentation within NUHM, physical as well as virtual resource centers linked to the NUHM website, and courses and curricula for developing urban health cadres. Another important avenue for investment is the HMIS software, as identified by the HUP team. \n3. Expand the scope of urban health in the medium term to demonstrate a model which includes comprehensive health services, disaster management, epidemic management, environmental health, solid waste management, community insurance models, and lifestyle issues. In the short term, advocate for a comprehensive urban services package, men’s health, and innovative models of primary health care delivery to overcome current gaps in human resources. Examples include primary health care models which are led by nurse practitioners, models managed by communities and models involving partnerships with the private sector (social franchising).\n 4. Consider avenues for supporting NUHM. Options include\n• Extend the program by 18 months until the Asian Development Bank TA takes over to ensure continued velocity of NUHM and support the maturation of a program that has been nurtured by USAID for over two decades. \n• Create HUP phase II with renewed objectives that address emerging challenges to the NUHM, health determinants, and urban development; in the interim period, engage with national and state level NUHM through a development partners’ forum to inform and advocate for the successes of HUP. \n• Start afresh; invest in the creation of large-scale private sector models which are co-funded by large municipal corporations to serve the urban vulnerable population, especially in mega cities. \n\nRecommendations for NUHM \n1. Ensure continued engagement of MAS and ASHAs through partnership with community-based organizations to carry out vulnerability assessment and community action; introduce mechanisms for formally identifying members as community volunteers and linking them to employment, entrepreneurial, insurance schemes, and development opportunities; develop revised norms for ASHA incentives and mechanisms and issue financial guidelines to MAS. \n2. Establish platforms to address men’s health issues such as substance abuse, tuberculosis, sexually transmitted diseases e.g. the human immunodeficiency virus, and leverage men’s participation in community health and action. \n3. Consider incorporation of the WCC strategy within the NUHM framework as these can be leveraged for micro-planning, monitoring, and mobilizing services. \n4. Orient and advocate to states the flexibilities within the NUHM framework and encourage innovations by creating flexible funding mechanisms. \n5. Develop a customized behavior change communication strategy following identification of specific urban needs. The placement of Public Health Managers at the urban public health centers will accelerate this process. \n\nPhase out recommendations for HUP \n1. Document and disseminate the successes of vulnerability mapping and WCCs to create a demand. Document experiences as well as processes to ensure their utility and effective implementation. Process documents include: processes for forming MAS, conducting a UHND, managing WCCs, carrying out CHP, and convergent decision making. \n2. Delineate an exit strategy. Initiate institutional processes at GOI level for expanding public health center services/human resource norms and strengthening intradepartmental coordination. At the city level, the exit strategy must include the identification of a support agency to provide needs- based TA, NGO partners to support community processes, a city resource center equipped with a set of HUP products and process documents, and key multi-sectoral officials at the state level with which city teams could link.\n",

      "Key Recommendations": "R1.1: USAID should continue current REDD+ work and consider expanding\nthroughout the coast, as described later in this report.\nR2.1: Next generation USAID climate change investments should place relatively\ngreater emphasis on community-wide participation and immediate direct\ncommunity economic benefits to ensure sustainability. This should be independent\nof REDD+ project sales.\nR2.2: Future USAID REDD+ efforts should review the Theory of Change to\nconsider how community members could enjoy greater immediate- and mid-term\nbenefits from the process of developing REDD+ projects through more local labor.\nR2.3: USAID should maintain support to Fondo Acción until community capacity\nis increased and some alternative sources of income (ASI) streams are sustainable.\nR2.4: Future REDD+ efforts should consider how to develop REDD+ projects of\nsufficient scale to attract investors, combining smaller communities, as was done by\nBIOREDD+.\nR2A.1: Support of Fondo Acción and future USAID support to community\nmanagement bodies should strive to make them capable of fully managing REDD+\nprograms.\nR2A.2: Future USAID projects working on REDD+ should build on years of\nUSAID investment in the coast and BIOREDD+ progress, linking consejos to help\nthe consejos and resguardos become a unified force for mutual learning and policy\ndialogue and to help achieve economies of scale.\nR2B.1: USAID should use its agreement with Fondo Acción to help develop the\ncommunity-wide support necessary to implement a REDD+ program. This will\nbecome particularly urgent as communities shift from pre-REDD+ to REDD+\nimplementation.\nR2B.2: If USAID should shift to a pseudo-REDD+ model with existing partners to\nprovide incentives for REDD+ behaviors, expanding understanding and\ncommitment to the full community will become urgent.\nR2C.1: Future USAID programs working on REDD+ should include proactive\napproaches to reach out to women and youth and design initiatives to tailor\nactivities to their needs, especially regarding economic opportunity.\n\nR2C.2: The approach should include an overall strategy grounded in Colombian\nREDD+ experience and implemented through annual gender work plans. Elements\ncould include economic empowerment, encouraging women to work in consulting\ncontracts and reaching out to community women.\n\nR2C.3: Economic indicatives aimed at women should be defined, as much as\npossible, by women. Some potential areas include ecotourism and forest promotion.\n\nR2C.4: When possible, have women consultants work in the field to spur women's\nparticipation.\nR2C.5: In general, REDD+ programs should try to have those who intervene in\ncommunities resemble their target communities. Communities are keen to work\nwith ethnically and culturally similar individuals. Women also appreciate working\nwith women.\n\nR2C.6: Once projects shift to implementation, it would be wise to make special\nefforts to reach out to youth as they will be the future resource stewards.\nR2D.1: One dimension of the Fondo Acción support should be to improve\nmanagement bodies’ systems to the point where they will increasingly be able to\nmanage REDD+ funds. Caution should be used to avoid rushing to this stage, as\nskill development must proceed with accountability.\nR2D.2: Likewise, in future REDD+ interventions, USAID should strive to assist\nmanagement bodies to be able to manage their own funds, but with a measured\npace, and beginning with accountability measures to contain corruption.\nR2F.1: Future REDD+\ninterventions should be designed to\nmove beyond business plans to\nactually produce benefits. This\nwould not only ensure communities\nactually benefit, with or without a\nsale, but would also demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of the future\nREDD+ product to potential\ninvestors.\nR2F.2: In future REDD+ programs, and other USAID work, IPs that help initiate business should do so with\ncomplete planning and a firm commitment to enterprise sustainability, or at least\nbeing on a sustainable course before the project ends.\nR2F.3: As part of picking up the reins from BIOREDD+, Fondo Acción may want\nto review the ASI plans to ensure community and cross-community compatibility\nand that communities understand some of the more complex aspects of the\narrangements.\nR2F.4: Likewise, Fondo Acción should monitor local enterprises started by\nBIOREDD+ and help them to achieve sustainability.\nR2F.5: Future USAID REDD+ initiatives should learn from the impressive work of\nBIOREDD+ attracting GOC investment.\nR3.1: USAID should discuss the issue of community rights to carbon benefits with\nthe GOC vigorously and help build local constituencies among Pacific communities to retain their rights to benefit fully from the resources.\nR3.2: In the medium-term, future USAID-supported REDD+ initiatives should not\nplace total emphasis on obtaining external investment. Rather, they should use the\nmechanism to support conservation and development, while preparing communities\nfor REDD+ at a moderate pace, and funding conservation success.\nR3.3: The Mission could leverage the opportunities to provide economic incentives\nto communities that have met REDD+ requirements while they develop valuable\nexperience implementing the model and continue to market their carbon products\ninternationally.\nR3.4: Such a practice could help establish a critical mass of REDD+ activities to\nsupport scale up.\nR3.5: Such a community of REDD+ projects would provide an excellent laboratory\nfor testing the utility of REDD+ schemes as well as an opportunity to learn from\nthem. It could specify and validate the model, reduce learning cycle time, build\ncommon understanding, cut costs, improve impact, and influence the international\nREDD+ dialogue.\nR4.1: USAID should consider following BIOREDD+ with a REDD+ network to\nwork with the GOC to develop the Pacific coast as an uninterrupted REDD+\nreservoir.\nR4.2: This would require developing a scaling-up strategy and working closely with\nthe government.\nR4.3: Most likely, it would involve donor/GOC provided incentives, as if they were\nREDD+ investors, while the carbon market recovers to expand the number of\ncommunities pursuing REDD+ programs. Since the market is not now viable,\ndonors, the private sector, and GOC could fund such initiatives. Incentives could\nfeed the model, support development, and help transition to a time when the carbon\nmarket improves.\nR4.4: Participating communities would need to satisfy REDD+ standards to receive\nthe floor price.\nR4.5: Such a large-scale project could leverage earmarks (Afro-Colombian,\nBiodiversity, and Climate Change) into an integrated approach that could\ntransform the Pacific while supporting USAID transition and conserving critical\nbiodiversity and forest resources.\nR4.6: This is a no-regrets approach. If the market improves, it could provide an\nunprecedented boom in private sector investment. If the market remains sluggish,\nthe incentive approach will support focused development that sustainably combats\nclimate change.\nR4.7: Future REDD+ projects should build on the five REDD+ initiatives in the\nPacific by consciously linking REDD+-committed communities, possibly through an\ninformal association.\nR4.8: As long as the carbon market remains anemic, future scale-up efforts should\nmodify the approach used in BIOREDD+ to increase content directed at community\ndevelopment, and prioritize governance and economic development impacts over\ncompliance with REDD+ requirements. All must be accomplished; it is a question of\nphasing and priorities.\nR4.9: In so doing, the Mission should consider leading-edge scale-up methodologies\nto ensure success.\nR4.10: If USAID decides to continue with REDD+ work, it would be advisable to\ncarefully review prior Mission experience in the Pacific region regarding community participation to complement BIOREDD+ experience and develop an\noptimal model.\nR4.11: The Mission should validate that additional communities can leverage\nexisting NASA research and obtain carbon estimates at minor marginal cost.\nR4.12: USAID should consider developing a rigorous learning element to\ncomplement such a REDD+ scale up. It could specify and validate the model, reduce\nlearning cycle time, build common understanding, cut costs, and improve impact\nR4.13: If it could support a critical mass of REDD+ “learning laboratories,”\nUSAID/Colombia’s rigorous learning agenda could influence the international\nREDD+ dialogue, possibly in favor of community members.",

      "Key Findings": "1. SBEP was highly effective at opening citizens’ eyes to economic opportunities around them, inspiring them to try new approaches and aim high when it came to what they could accomplish.\n2. Among country partner observers of SBEP in Regional Development Centers and municipal governments, SBEP’s assistance leading to the formation of LAGs across four regions was often considered the most significant change the project introduced. \n3. USAID’s decision to rely on bottom-up suggestions on its project’s economic development priorities was much appreciated by mayors, local economic development office representatives, and municipal private sector representatives, and viewed as right for the country’s stage of economic development.\n4. The scale of SBEP initiatives may not have been large or gained early enough traction to achieve the kind of “critical mass” of awareness and evidence needed to spark their continued growth\nand diffusion within or beyond their regions of demonstration.\n5. SBEP’s influence on regional development trends may become more detectable and significant over time.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. In future large and complex economic growth projects, improve the balance between monitoring for accountability (at the input level) and monitoring to support adaptive management of economic development projects (at the intermediate result and outcome levels).\n2. When selecting performance indicators, carefully examine what they tell the Mission – not only about a particular result but also about the likelihood of achieving higher-level results.\n3. For product-based economic development activities, encourage USAID partners to undertake – while USAID funding is in place - actions that would improve the integration of those products\ninto broader supply chains, including those that reach into international markets on both the import and export sides.\n4. For projects in economic growth and other sectors in which long-term and goal-level success depends on the institutionalization of initiatives in government or their continued existence on a business basis, elevate thinking about sustainability for those which must be self-financing to business plans with milestones that can be monitored and self-sufficiency outcomes to be realized before USAID’s support terminates.",

Of the papers that are available, they are focused on holistic approaches that are being used such as villages, groups, whole family training, and farmer field schools (FFS). These few documents discuss approaches that are being used specifically to reach women. The only information we were able to find was on the group approach, such as farmer field schools, thrift and credit, and use of ICTs and training. However, none of these were focused on women farmers. Entrepreneurship was also mentioned as an approach to reaching women.",

      "Document Title": "Review of Programmatic Responses to Adolescent and Women's Nutritional Needs in Low and Middle Income Countries",
      "Key Findings": "This review includes a total of 53 programs that reported efforts to improve the nutritional status of adolescent girls and/or WRA in LMIC between 2004 and 2014. Priority nutrition practices have been promoted or delivered through a broad range of delivery platforms,\nstrategies, and activities which have been grouped into the following categories:\n\n• Community-based platforms for nutrition education and promotion\n• Mass media\n• Distribution of micronutrients, food, or cash\n• Capacity building of health workers (or other service delivery agents)\n• Capacity building of local organizations / governments\n• Policy/strategy/protocol development\n\nFigure 1 shows the frequency that each delivery strategy or activity was used by the programs reviewed. Capacity building of local organizations / governments (31 programs, 58 percent) and community-based platforms for nutrition education and promotion (28 programs, 53 percent) were used most often while distribution of\nmicronutrients, food, or cash (17 programs, 32 percent) and mass media (10 programs, 19 percent) were used least often. The nutrition practices targeted by the projects and programs studied were grouped as follows:\n\n• Improved eating practices4\n• Consumption of a diverse diet\n• Purchase/consumption of fortified foods\n• Intake of adequate amounts of water\n• Consumption/intake of IFA/iron\n• Consumption/intake of micronutrient supplements\n\nNone of the programs reported promoting rest during pregnancy.  Nutrition-sensitive practices were considered beyond the scope of this review. As illustrated in Figure 2, the most commonly promoted nutrition practices were described as improved eating practices (30 programs, 57 percent) followed by the intake of IFA/iron (20 programs, 38 percent), consumption of a diverse diet (14 programs, 26 percent), and purchase/consumption of fortified foods (11 programs, 21 percent). Few programs promoted the intake of micronutrient supplements (4 programs, 8 percent), intake of adequate amounts of water (2 programs, 4 percent), and the consumption of additional food (1 program, 2 percent) as a priority practice. Programs identified through the search are described in the sections below. Those programs that aimed to improve the nutritional status of more than one population of interest, and provided specific information for each targeted population, are described in each corresponding section.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Based on the synthesis of the literature findings and survey responses, the following policy-level\nrecommendations are made: 1) address nutrition of adolescent girls and WRA in policies, systems, and guidelines;\n2) define adolescence and bring attention to the specific nutritional needs of adolescent girls; 3) disaggregate\ndata by age and gender at the national level; 4) integrate nutrition guidelines into existing adolescent, maternal\nand child health, prevention of maternal to child transmission of HIV , and other guidelines that address services\nfor WRA; and; 5) streamline and collaborate at all levels. With respect to nutrition programming for adolescent\ngirls and WRA, the paper identified the following: 1) expand upon lessons learned from IFA programs; 2) consider\ninterventions to prevent and address risk factors for nutrition-related noncommunicable diseases (N-RNCDs); 3)\nidentify platforms to address the nutritional needs of women outside of pregnancy and lactation periods; 4)\ninvolve women and communities in nutritional program planning; 5) identify opportunities for multisectoral\ncollaborations and program integration; and, 6) address gender norms.",

Child-focused programs are more effective at addressing child-level outcomes while income support for consumption may address multiple drivers of family-child separation. However, More evidence is needed on HES interventions and their impact on children.",
      "Key Recommendations": "• Link families with government-led social protection and local economic empowerment programs where relevant and appropriate.\n• Consider holding emergency funds to help families reintegrating children or at very high risk of separation cope with shocks.\n• Investigate sequenced HES approaches with realistic expectations, bearing in mind both family and implementing agency capacity, programming timeframes, and geographic constraints.\n• Work on tools and approaches to capture separation risk and durability of reintegration, taking into account the challenges associated with finding and reaching the small proportion of children at risk of separation or reintegrating into family care.\n• Hypothesize and test causal pathways related to HES interventions and drivers of family-child separation.\n",

      "Document Title": "Local Private Sector Partnerships: Assessing the State of Practice in USAID's Partnerships with Local Private Sector Actors",
      "Key Findings": "This assessment revealed several key messages from the current state of practice: Partnerships with local companies can deliver unique and significant value to collaborations with USAID. Depending on the context, USAID can derive distinct benefits from LPSPs that may be different from partnerships with multinational companies. Local partners offer access to local networks and, potentially, local investments. The value of their deep local knowledge was highlighted by nearly everyone interviewed for this paper, citing the particular benefits of “homegrown solutions” for local development challenges. Sometimes this local knowledge translated into a higher tolerance for risk, as exemplified in the Chocolate Tumaco partnership in Colombia. USAID colleagues also felt that local firms are often inextricably committed to the local market and that this connection can benefit Agency partnerships. “They are in it for the long run,” said a colleague. Flexibility and responsiveness were also mentioned — local partners are sometimes perceived as more accessible and more willing to change course mid-stream. Finally, and most critically, when local partners change their perspective on engagement around social issues, this can have a powerful and significant effect. “Our partnership woke up the [local] corporate world to the benefits of doing good,” said a colleague in Africa. Local companies also find distinct benefits to partnering with USAID. Colleagues reported that local partners appreciate USAID’s convening power — including its connections to international organizations and its government-to-government relationships — in ways that multinational companies may not. \nThis fact prompted one colleague to assert, “USAID has far more relevance [in this country] through convening power than through budget.” Local partners also value the Agency’s ability to connect them to international networks and expertise, and to act as a neutral party in complex situations. Local companies are motivated to invest in social and environmental issues for a variety of reasons; these reasons are best understood within the context of the local system. Local systems are likely to shape LPSPs to a greater extent than partnerships with international firms. Specifically, national politics and domestic economic issues can play a role in ways that may not be relevant for multinational partners. For example, a local company’s ties to certain politicians or political parties may have implications for partnerships with USAID. Local firms engage around social issues from a variety of perspectives. Local company partnerships can be analyzed along the spectrum from philanthropy to “shared value” approaches, but these terms may be nuanced in the local context. Most colleagues interviewed for this paper thought that these concepts were often less developed in the countries where USAID works. “Firms [here] are still learning why [social] investments are important,” said one colleague. Some colleagues saw a role for USAID in advising local firms on how to make Corporate Social Responsibility approaches more strategic. \nOthers saw value in encouraging local firms to consider more shared value approaches. “We want thought leaders in the local private sector,” said one colleague. Another added, “Our effort to engage [local companies] is a very significant opportunity to encourage them to be globally responsible.” USAID practitioners can draw upon a wealth of LPSP knowledge and experience that exists across the Agency. Although this paper is a first assessment and identifies emerging trends, Agency colleagues can explore multiple models and approaches that have been successful in a variety of contexts. Interviews identified how Missions are engaging local partners, through focusing on strong relationships, mapping the local private sector, and using annual program statements. Although the due diligence process for local partners can be challenging, many colleagues are drawing on local networks to assess partnering risk. Finally, Mission colleagues have found success in technical approaches such as embedding local partners into existing USAID activities, utilizing procurement instruments that would allow relatively small co-investments, asking implementing partners to manage local company relationships, and linking technical assistance to local partnerships.\n",

      "Key Findings": "A plurality of the 35 projects, 16 (45.8%), received a mixed rating, meaning they had both positive and negative key findings. Nine projects (25.7%) were deemed unsatisfactory and seven (20%) satisfactory. Last, three projects (8.6%) could not be rated based on their evaluations alone. Looking at the project ratings by USAID technical office and sector provides some suggestions of trends. The Office of Agriculture’s projects were generally implemented well: three of four agriculture projects received satisfactory ratings.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. Standardize evaluation SOWs by defining the concepts effectiveness, efficiency, and sustainability. Ask evaluators straightforward questions addressing these issues.\n2. Key activity personnel should utilize monitoring data throughout the project so that if there are problems with capturing data or the M&E system more broadly, they are discovered early.\n3. USAID/Afghanistan should continue to prioritize timeliness of evaluations. In fiscal year 2014, only 33% of evaluations were done on time; in fiscal year 2015, 75% were timely. Where useful, independent midterm performance evaluations should be conducted to enable course-corrections to occur.\n4. USAID/Afghanistan should continue to prioritize population of the recommendation utilization template by CORs immediately following the completion of the evaluation report.\n5. OPPD should ensure that Program Development Officers use recommendations to inform new activity/project design by requiring evaluation utilization to be part of all new activity reviews, as well as portfolio reviews.",

      "Key Findings": "• Evaluations are doing a better job compared to prior years of addressing gender differentials and providing sex-disaggregated data for evaluation findings, where appropriate. \n• The number of E3 evaluations addressing gender differentials in project access, participation, or benefits rose from a low of 15 percent in 2011 to 67 percent in 2014. \n• The number of E3 evaluations providing sex-disaggregated data on evaluation findings at all levels increased from 7 percent in 2010 to 53 percent in 2014. \n• Evaluation reports highlighted the importance of the availability of sex-disaggregated project data in contextualizing and understanding project results. \n• Evaluation reports noted the need to consider the implications of gender norms during project design. Evaluations from across all sectors recognized the workload of women in the household as an impediment to gaining access to education, resources, knowledge, and community participation.\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "In order to improve gender integration, the study recommends that:\nUSAID Program Offices ensure that Mission Orders and other operating unit procedures are consistent with USAID’s guidance on integrating gender into all program cycle activities, including evaluation, and specifically with How-to Note: Engendering Evaluation at USAID. USAID Evaluation Points of Contact and others involved drafting evaluation Statements of Work (SOWs) explicitly include in the SOW:\n• Detailed expectations for data disaggregation by sex for each evaluation question, as well as information to be obtained on specific gender concerns;\n• A requirement that evaluators go beyond simply referencing sex-disaggregated data to document whether activities are actually reducing gender gaps, consistent with USAID guidance on engendering evaluations; and\n• Clear expectations for the evaluation team to include members with experience in gender programming, performance monitoring, evaluation and/or research, when there are gender concerns.\n",

      "Key Findings": "The level of uncertainty for development support is high in the near term, due to the major shift in global goals and strategies, the refugee crisis in Europe, other humanitarian crises including fragile states, and impending changes in leadership of institutions key for child health.  The implications of the shift to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for health and/or children are still emerging, but priorities, political commitment, and likely funding will be more broadly distributed and possibly with less clarity of purpose. If any of these resources are “zero-sum,” child health (other than immunization) is likely to be working with less.  The World Bank has heightened its presence in reproductive, maternal, newborn, child, and adolescent health (RMNCAH) with the Global Financing Facility (GFF). There is political reliance on the GFF to finance and rationalize financing of child health, especially those components not financed through GAVI or the Global Fund. However, there is a high level of uncertainty about its potential effectiveness.  The high-level core architecture for child health (and RMNCAH more broadly) is emerging. It will be very important to track the place and priority of child health within this architecture.",
      "Key Recommendations": "With the shift to the SDGs, child health should be deliberately reframed so that it emphasizes the value of children, a more holistic approach including “newborns and infants and children” as one, and a clear aim for equity.\n\nThe principal global partners in child health need to come to agreement on and then designate and support a lead organization to consistently provide overall messaging for child health.\n\nKey stakeholders need to create and implement a shared strategic approach for:\na) Raising the visibility of child health as a whole rather than in subcomponents\nb) Ensuring a strong child health voice in Strategy 2.0, SDG3 monitoring, and the GFF\nc) Bridging child health components of existing strategies across institutions in such a way that country action is more likely\n",

      "Document Title": "Waste Management Technologies in Regions, Georgia: Solid Waste Collection and Recycling System Assessment Report",
      "Key Recommendations": "Based on assessment observations and findings related to the existing SWM situations in the target regions, the following are recommended focus areas for Project assistance activities. Preliminary actions plans for proposed assistance sub‐activities for the coming year are presented in Annex 2.\nKakheti Region ‐ The individual relationships that exist between Kakheti municipalities and their LLC operating companies presents a classic and holistic SWM planning and development approach to solid waste management at the local level with some development elements that extend to the\nregional and, possibly, national context. Due to the existing national procurement law concerning the\ntender and contracting process for the LLCs, it is difficult to envision that there will be significant\ncompetition for the existing LLCs in the near term. A scenario similar to that in Adjara where the\nBatumi LLC provides regional services to all of the municipalities in the region is not likely in Kakheti\ngiven the relative size of the municipalities and the geographical distances between them.\nAccordingly, the existing LLCs should be considered as having a longer term relationship with the\nmunicipalities than the 1 year contract limit required by the national procurement law.\nAccordingly, the recommended assistance should focus on assisting the Kakheti municipalities and\ntheir respective LLCs in developing municipal solid waste management plans based on an anticipated\nlocal requirement for such plans in the pending legal framework and national strategy requirements.\nThe new code is expected to include a local requirement for incorporating recycling, recovery, and\ncomposting processes as a means for diverting solid waste components from landfill disposal as is\ncurrently mandated in E.U. SWM programs. The context for the municipal solid waste management\nplans will be the anticipated requirements as currently stipulated in the working draft of the new\nsolid waste law which states the following relative to the required content of the municipal solid\nwaste management plans: \nArticle 13 Municipal Waste Management Plan\n(1) Each municipality shall adopt a plan for the management of the municipal waste\nproduced within its territory for a period of five years. A Municipal Waste\nManagement Plan may be prepared jointly by neighbouring municipalities. The\nMunicipal Waste Management Plan shall be compliant with the National Waste\nManagement Plan and other plans under Article 12 paragraph 7 of this Law.\n(2) The adoption of the Municipal Waste Management Plan shall be preceded by public\nconsultations, involving the relevant stakeholders and the neighbouring\nmunicipalities. These public consultations shall be carried out by the respective\nmunicipality(ies).\n(3) The Municipal Waste Management Plan shall contain the following:\na) Information on the existing system for collection of waste from population;\nb) Data on the types and the amounts of non‐hazardous waste from population\ncollected, recovered and disposed of;\nc) Data on the types and the amounts of hazardous waste from population\ncollected, recovered and disposed of;\nd) Location of the waste treatment facilities;\ne) Planned measures to be taken for the establishment of separate collection and\nrecovery of municipal waste, including of biodegradable waste and packaging\nwaste; \nf) Planned construction of new waste treatment facilities;\ng) Programmes to raise awareness of the public on waste management issues;\nh) Implemented and planned measures for co‐operation with other municipalities\nin the field of waste management;\ni) The way and timeframe in which the proposed measures shall be implemented,\nresponsible persons, estimated costs and sources of financing for their\nimplementation.\n\nThese expected requirements should be the template for assistance provided to the Kakheti\nmunicipalities in developing their plans. If these requirements are changed in the final enactment of\nthe law, the municipal ISWM plan development process should be modified accordingly. Specific\nactivities that will be important considerations of working with the municipalities to develop the\nrecommended municipal solid waste management plans will, at a minimum, include the following:\n Increasing the institution capacity of the municipalities to manage the contractual relationship\nwith their LLC companies and to increase their financial capacity to make appropriate decisions\nconcerning service budgeting, system coverage expansion and periodic capital investments.\n Optimizing solid waste companies (but treating them somewhat as a municipal function due to\nthe tender process which almost assures their continuity in providing collection and cleansing\nservices) including defining the means for achieving service coverage expansion in conjunction\nwith capital investment decisions by the municipalities.\n Informal dump closure and remediation, if necessary (assumed to be treated as municipal\nfunction in the finally adopted national law and strategy).\n Defining the amount and type of solid waste that must be managed by the municipal system.\n Defining the type, amount and current disposal or recovery practices of other waste stream\ncomponents (industry, agribusiness, etc.) that exist in the region and that may be subject to the\nrequirements of the new law and national strategy.\n Sorting plant (or other recovery process) economic/technical viability assessment and design (to\ndetermine how such plants (or any other means for achieving the new law diversion objectives)\ncan become viable cost effective component of a municipality’s solid waste management plan)\nAdjara Autonomous Republic ‐ Because of the regional aspects of the SWM collection program in\nAdjara and the level of development supported by the EBRD in their project due diligence, planning\nand implementation process, the Project’s assistance activities in Adjara should be focused on\nselectively supporting specific stakeholders on specific issues of concern. Project assistance activity\nfocus areas should include the following:\n Municipal capacity building in: 1) the collection service tender/contract and collection\nperformance monitoring processes and 2) the collection service coverage expansion planning\nand implementation process. (This is intended to give the Adjara municipalities (outside of\nBatumi) an enhanced voice in collection/transport service delivery and coverage while helping\nthem understand the pros and cons of regional collection/transport program versus locally‐\nbased services.\n Recycling and recovery realities and private sector business plans to enhance market conditions\nfor future public sponsored recovery programs (As the key element of Component 2 of the\nProject, this should be done in conjunction with capacity building in the municipalities to\nunderstand the technical, business and economic aspects of the “sorting plants” that they have\nall expressed an interest in developing in their municipalities)\n Landfill technical and operational capacity building and operational planning with the Hygiene LTD state company at the time when the new regional landfill is about to come into operation\nBoth Regions ‐ The following are recommended Project activity focus areas that are anticipated\nto apply to both target regions (and may also have national applicability):\n Tariff Reform and Cost Recovery – While this is the important function of Component 3 of the\nProject, the need for effective optimized cost recovery will need to be emphasized as a key\nelement of developing the proposed municipal solid waste management plans in the Kakheti\nmunicipalities. In developing their SWM plans, the Kakheti municipalities will begin to\nunderstand the economic impact of enhanced SWM standards and programs with tariff reform\nand resulting enhanced cost recovery as a key objective of implementing their SWM plans.\n Public Outreach and Education ‐ While this is the important function of Component 4 of the\nProject, the development of the municipal ISWM plans in the Kakheti region must also focus on\nthe need and means for public understanding of 1) the future roles that waste generators in an\nenhanced ISWM system may have in the future particularly as it relates to an increased\nemphasis on recycling/recovery processes, 2) the evolution of waste generator willingness to\npay for better services based on environmental improvements (Unfortunately, willingness to pay\nfor effective environmentally sound landfills (which few people physically see) is often different\nfrom a willingness to pay for better collection service which everybody sees in their daily lives.)\nThis will need to be resolved in the Project design of its Public Awareness elements as they\nrelate to the above regional activities in addition to the general public awareness objectives\nassociated with the overall solid waste management process.)\n Closure requirements and processes ‐ Capacity building for the SWMCG in Kakheti and Hygiene\nLTD in Adjara for closure of currently active disposal areas when regional E.U. standard landfills\nbecome available in each target region.\n Closure requirements and processes ‐ Capacity building for closure and rehabilitation of the\ninformal dumping sites in municipal areas where formal collection is now provided now or in the\nfuture through coverage expansion.",

      "Key Recommendations": "Given the findings of this study and in consideration of the\nincreasing importance of the regional platform, a few key\nareas emerge for action.\nRecommendation #1: Develop a communication plan for\nraising awareness of the importance of regionalization\nand regional programming within USAID Washington and\nbilateral missions. Regional organizations are recognized by\nAfrican governments and international donors as key players\nwith strong policy influence. It is paramount for USAID to\ncontinue working with them as partners. The interviews\nand literature reviewed as part of this study reveal a lack of\nunderstanding related to the roles of regional organizations\nand processes of regional integration. Efforts must be made\nto demystify the topic and ultimately build consensus around\npriorities for engagement.\nRecommendation #2: Foster direct engagement and policy\ndialogue with regional networks and associations. Regional\nnetworks and associations have a keen understanding of\nrealities on the ground and play a key role in elevating policy\nissues and advocating for change. RECs and international\npartners should continue to engage with regional networks\nand associations to support policy monitoring and the role\nout of standards.\nRecommendation #3: Continue efforts to strengthen the\norganizational capacity of regional networks and associations.\nMany regional networks and associations have significant\norganizational weaknesses. In-depth organizational capacity\nassessments could be conducted to identify capacity gaps and\nfacilitate organizational capacity development interventions\nin the identified areas. Understanding individual networks’\nstrengths and weaknesses will allow potential partners\n(including USAID) to make better informed decisions about\nwho to work with.",

The level of understanding/support for PSE, however, varies within the GOR and there is a lack of systems and knowledge about how to engage the private sector, especially to develop PPPs. There is also a lack of effective coordination and clarity of roles and responsibilities between key stakeholders (MOH, RDB, RBC) that is limiting effective PSE. There is a lack of adequate capacity within the MOH, RDB, and RBC for effective PSE and PPP development and is limited dialogue and no formal platforms or systems for public and private engagement.",

      "Key Findings": "Based on the interviews conducted for this report, the PNG private sector’s view on investing in low emissions land use initiatives in PNG can be characterised as: (1) ‘open for discussion’ but new to the topic and not well informed, yet keen to learn more; (2) ‘broadly aware’ that investment in ‘green’ initiatives could benefit their corporate legitimacy and social responsibility obligations; and (3) ‘cautiously interested’ to contribute funds, but have major concerns that funding may be misappropriated (through corruption), particularly if PNG government entities are involved.\n\nIn summary, it appears that the private sector in PNG is potentially interested in investment in low carbon land use initiatives, but is presently poorly informed, cautious and skeptical and unlikely to voluntarily contribute any funds in the short-term (within the next 12 months), other than perhaps small-scale (e.g. US$25,000 to US$50,000) project specific-based funding.",
      "Key Recommendations": "The author recommends LEAF take the following two distinct short-term actions to pursue private sector funding opportunities (assuming no major advancements occur with REDD+ policy internationally or domestically).\n\nFirst, LEAF should forge a strong working relationship with the Ramu Development Fund (RDF; a fund recently established by the Madang Provincial Government that collects mandatory contributions from private sector business developers in the Province) to encourage and facilitate the RDF to include low emissions land use issues in its funding purview and possible submit to the RDF a proposal for the RDF to fund some of LEAF’s work in Madang.\n\nSecond, LEAF should forge a strong working relationship with the Port Moresby Chamber of Commerce.`",

      "Document Title": "Visakhapatnam, India Sanitation Assessment: Final Report",
      "Key Findings": "Strong political will exists to accelerate sanitation improvements. The current Municipal Commissioner of the GVMC, Mr. Pravin Kumar, IAS, is a champion of sanitation and the Smart City Initiative. He participated in the 2015 International Fecal Sludge Management 3 Conference in Hanoi, Vietnam, and has an impressive technical understanding of the city’s current sanitation needs. During meetings with the assessment team, Mr. Kumar confirmed our initial findings and provided additional insights into numerous areas of improvement needed along the SVC. His commitment to improving sanitation was echoed by the cooperation of multiple department heads within the GVMC and the impressive understanding of their existing service needs and successes. Sanitation sector stakeholders are eager to engage with the GVMC and improve sanitation services. The assessment team conducted individual and small group interviews with over 40 professionals with a role in the sanitation sector of Visakhapatnam. During the Sanitation Town Hall, these stakeholders were given a platform to voice strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats to achieving universal sanitation in Visakhapatnam. The consultation facilitated discussions on critical concerns and topics such as STPs and increasing access to household toilets; a participatory mapping exercise captured the network interactions across the different stakeholder groups. Workshop participants came away with a better understanding of the multitude of actors working in the sector. Communication channels between civil society organizations and the GVMC should be formalized. \n\nAccountability could be strengthened across all stakeholders, but particularly around private service providers (community toilets) and the members of the vacuum truck association. The Town Hall SWOT revealed general consensus that a solid foundation exists in the city for the provision of sanitation services. The treatment capacity at the existing STPs and proposed extension of sanitation services demonstrate the GVMC’s commitment to providing city-wide coverage. Additionally, the high turnout for the event reflected strong commitment from nongovernmental stakeholders to improving services. Numerous opportunities for quick wins to improve sanitation services were identified and discussed, with significant emphasis on improving household access to toilets and increasing the use and functionality of community toilets.\n\nBetter coordination within the GVMC is needed to improve knowledge and data sharing. The GVMC has a wealth of information and technical expertise for sanitation service provision, yet the assessment team found that this knowledge and data on sanitation schemes were located in different pockets within the municipal corporation. Myopic focus on expanding sewerage does not consider decentralized fecal sludge management. The GVMC’s ambitious agenda to expand coverage of UGD sewerage along with a rapid expansion of STP capacity is laudable. However, policy makers should be reminded that sewerage is only one option in a suite of alternatives for increasing sanitation services in urban areas. As witnessed by the GVMC’s current under performance, sewerage is difficult to maintain and services at this level are likely to remain out of the reach of hundreds of thousands of residents in slum areas for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe regulatory environment is weak. Overall, STP operators are the only regulated service\nproviders in the city. The AP-PCB regularly monitors wastewater entering the STPs and the quality of the treated effluent, as does the contractor charged with operating the STP on behalf of the GVMC. If effluent does not meet regulated standards, the AP-PCB notifies the GVMC, but no penalty or corrective action is enforced in practice. This lack of enforcement extends across\nviolations taking place throughout the SVC, the most egregious example being the unregulated\ndumping of raw fecal sludge by the septic tank emptiers. Gender and socio-economic bias remains a significant hurdle to achieving universal sanitation services. Data provided by the GVMC for community toilet facilities show a disproportionate number of facilities for men, including the new eToilets that are exclusively for males. Stakeholder interviews revealed that women do not regularly use community toilets, except to deposit used menstrual hygiene products, because of safety concerns or lack of cleanliness. Women also expressed equity issues with individual toilet use in their homes, as it is common for household toilets to be solely used by the men and for women to practice OD. This culturally sensitive practice contradicts the assertion that only residents of households without toilets defecate in the open, as a potentially large number of women living in households with toilets do not use them regularly. In these instances, the disposal of infant and children’s stools, often a female responsibility, is also likely not being performed in a safe and hygienic manner.\n\nFinancial investments are focused on new capital investments but ignore other life-cycle costs. The GVMC’s annual sanitation-related budget allocations and expenditures reflect the political focus on investing in large infrastructure. Funding comes from a number of different sources, including the JNNURM, RAY, and minor contributions from the Thirteenth Finance Commission. For 2015, the GVMC has budgeted INR 8.62 billion (US$135 million) for investment in sewerage and sanitation, yet the Department of Engineering estimates needing an additional INR 16 billion (US$251 million) to complete ongoing sewage treatment activities. In addition to a total disregard to low-tech fecal sludge management approaches, the O&M budget reveals hardly any money spent on repairing the sewerage drains (only INR 96,400 [US$1,500] in 2013) or clearing storm water drains and other such maintenance activities. Significant investments are needed to repair and renovate STPs and community toilets. Field observations noted that STP and community toilet O&M contractors were dissatisfied and frustrated with the funding allocated from the GVMC for operational expenditure (OpEx) and capital maintenance expenditure (CapManEx). OpEx is typically covered by lump-sum service contracts that do not accurately account for all daily expenditures for contractors (e.g., cleaning supplies for toilet facilities and fuel for generators at STPs). CapManEx funding, for items like replacement urinal doors or agitators for STP mixing chambers, is often delayed due to bureaucratic red tape and can take months to be dispersed, often delaying major repairs and taking vital systems offline that in turn reduce the level of services provided.\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "Opportunity: Building off the momentum from town hall meeting, the GVMC could organize and\nchair a regular meeting with civil society and the private sector to discuss sanitation.\nOpportunity: While investment should be made in long-term data management systems, the\ncurrent arrangements for the sanitation working group related to the CSP (in development) can be\nbetter leveraged for coordination across departments, including Engineering, Health, Urban\nCommunity Development, City Planning, and Revenue and Accounts, to move the CSP forward.\nJoint efforts should also be increased to improve systems and investment across the SVC. The\nGVMC could improve data sharing and coordination through improved IT solutions, such as\nnetwork or cloud-based storage and awareness-raising activities between different units working in\nthe sanitation sector.\nOpportunity: The GVMC should consider a range of fecal sludge treatment options including\ndecentralized treatment processes, condominial sewers, digesters, wetlands, and pond systems to\ncomplement the UGD network. Such technologies are urgently needed given the current practice of\ndumping waste directly into the environment. Per capita investments in fecal sludge management\nmay prove to be more cost effective than the STP, with immediate results for low-income residents.\nInvesting in a pilot project to install digesters in neighborhoods with a high ratio of septic tanks (i.e.,\nhighly frequented by vacuum trucks) would provide a tangible alternative to illegal dumping in the\nnear term.\nOpportunity: At a minimum, the GVMC should require members of the association of septic tank\nemptiers to keep basic records on their clients, the volume of sludge extracted, and locations of the\ntipped sludge. This data is critical to better quantify the scope of the dumping dilemma and design\noptions for decentralized fecal sludge management models mentioned above. Additional policies and regulations exist on the provision of independent sanitation facilities for\npublic transportation facilities, large commercial properties, hospitals, and industrial facilities, as\noutlined in the Code of Basic Requirements for Water Supply, Drainage, and Sanitation by the Bureau of\nIndian Standards. The GVMC and AP-PCB acknowledge that these standards exist and some\nlocations comply with them (e.g., the Four Points Sheraton Hotel maintains its own mini-STP).\nHowever, these facilities are not regulated or inspected by the GVMC or the AP-PCB, and no\ncomprehensive data set exists on the compliance of these facilities.\nOpportunity: Further research is needed to understand the full impact that gender plays in\nsanitation practices, particularly open defecation, in Visakhapatnam.\nThe assessment team also observed inequities in toilet access for the extreme poor. Sanitation in\nslums areas, both notified and non-notified, are a perennial challenge due to land tenure issues\nrelated to encroachment on vacant areas without permission. An estimated 195,000 households\ninhabit 711 notified slums in Visakhapatnam, many are in need of individual toilets. At least 33,500\nhouseholds do not have individual toilets, with almost 30,000 households reporting some practice of\nopen defecation. Field visits to the Indiranagar slum revealed that although the GVMC built houses\nfor the poor, they have not provided individual toilets. Most of the households complained of lack of\nspace to build the new toilets while many said that they cannot afford to build their own.\nOpportunity: The majority of OD in Visakhapatnam is believed to occur in slums. The city has the\nhighest rate of slum dwellers of any municipality in India, so tracking sanitation practices in these\nareas should be among the highest priorities for the GVMC. A comprehensive study is needed to\ndetermine the actual OD rates within Visakhapatnam and to identify the primary drivers that\nsupport this practice.",

      "Key Recommendations": "Together, the findings and conclusions of the 2009 study of the ProExAg and Exitos projects and the 2010 assessment highlighted several key lessons: \n1. When promoting NTAE crops, breaking into a new sector requires careful planning and taking a thorough, critical look at the opportunities and constraints and level of external support required to sustain success, typically a 10–15 year endeavor; \n2. Diversify the mix of non-traditional crops as winners cannot be predicted with certainty and slow-starters may take off later; \n3. Governments need to improve the transparency, availability and timing of export sector information to help sustain existing exports and promote new ones; and \n4. The opportunity for small-scale rural producers to participate in growing, harvesting, and packing NTAE crops creates labor-intensive job opportunities at higher wages.\n",

      "Key Findings": "Within the region, South Africa is the largest market for impact investing, with a particularly active set of domestic South African DFIs that fund South African enterprises. The majority of impact capital in the region has come from international DFIs and a range of non-DFI impact investors. Even excluding this strong domestic activity, South Africa is the center of Southern African impact investing.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. Leverage technical assistance (TA) facilities to build the pre-investment pipeline: More pre-investment support for businesses is needed to develop a strong pipeline of investable opportunities. Increasingly, TA funders (e.g., USAID and DFID) recognize the importance of pre-investment support to get companies to the point where they can successfully raise capital.\n\n2. Develop sector specialization: Beyond bringing capital to portfolio companies, impact investors can drive growth, returns, and impact by focusing on the specific sectors in which their portfolio companies operate.\n\n3. Expand investment instruments: With the variety of early-stage businesses in Southern Africa, structured investments, such as milestone-based conversion and profit-sharing debt, can help to creatively fill a significant need for financing that straight equity and debt deals cannot.\n",

      "Key Findings": "This landscape study provides an overview of Honduras’s agriculture and the status of the country’s extension system. It also contains information on the prevalence of poverty, nutrition, and gender-related issues in the country with special focus on rural areas. The report summarizes Honduras’s current agricultural and nutrition policy and details the strategic goals and objectives of USAID and other donors in the country. The report provides a summary of the on-going projects by the United States Government (USG) and other donors in the country related to agriculture extension, and gender and nutrition impacts.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Institutional Capacity Building: Both the governmental agency DICTA and the NGO Oxfam expressed a need for information sharing among key agencies in understanding the needs and perceptions of indigenous communities, including effective ways of meeting community needs.\n\nCapacity Building for Women Farmers: Many governmental organizations have expressed a need for capacity building of women farmers on various topics related to gender, nutrition, and agriculture. MANCORSARIC has a need for regionally appropriate and simple materials on maternal and infant health as well as sexual education for young women at high risk of pregnancy.\n\nDissemination of Innovations for Women Farmers: The meeting with the for-profit institution Camosa Camiones prompted the team to look for manufacturers of small-scale equipment that is more appropriate for smallholders. An engineer for the Trilateral Cooperative demonstrated some smaller equipment he had designed with recycled materials for a lower cost.\n\nEngaging Men and Women: The Women’s Office in Cabanas expressed a need for research on gender-based violence (GBV), and if formal reporting mechanisms are appropriate to address the GBV problem. Based on these findings, there could be an opportunity to write up this model as a case study or facilitate an exchange between the gender specialist and other people in her same position in other municipalities to share lessons learned and best practices for reporting violent crimes.\n",

Nearly a third of Tanzanians live in poverty and the rate of stunting in children under five is 35%. With the majority of Tanzanians employed in agriculture, growth in this sector is a promising route for poverty reduction. In order to achieve the ambitious goals of growth in the agricultural sector, it is necessary to empower women. While discrimination against women is technically illegal, customary laws and practices that discriminate against women are still common.",

      "Document Title": "Feasibility Study of the US-Pakistan Knowledge Corridor Scholarship Program",
      "Key Findings": "We can learn from past individual training programs and understand that there is an overemphasis on the individual's training objectives. Furthermore, institutional strengthening and training is conceived as separate with little crossover leverage. In programs with a clear focus on institutional strengthening, training is viewed as the driver to improve institutional performance. Additionally, institutional needs assessments are often biased towards identifying gaps in human resources, and particularly technical knowledge.\n\nThere is also minimal connection to home-country institutions and increasing but still limited attempts to build soft skills have been made. Action planning is not generally integrated into training programs and mentoring can be better utilized as a tool for institutional capacity development.\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "Recommendations for aligning program goals:\n1. Take an integrated approach leveraging individual training for institutional performance improvement.\n2. Start small, scale up to meet the broader goals for Pakistan’s higher education sector.\n3. Give serious consideration to the value of training students in cohorts.\n4. Find ways to further align the scholarship program with HEC’s goals for enhancing IT-embedded teaching and learning into the program.\n5. Consider supporting EdD, MFA/MS and MA degrees when those degrees are the terminal degree in the field.\n\nRecommendations for implementation:\nHighlighted Recommendations:\n• Invest in placement and advising services.\n• Invest significantly more in the preparation of students, beyond GRE and TOEFL.\n• Utilize action planning for HEC scholars.\n• Change eligibility criteria for students.\n• Adjust the timeline for recruitment to an 18-month cycle.\n• Send students on a J-1 visa.\n• Use Carnegie Classification to determine eligible host universities.\n• Invest in support to returning students – think about incentives beyond the five-year obligation.\n• Build in opportunities to conduct research in Pakistan during dissertation period.\n• Set up a competitive fund for dissertation research.",

      "Key Findings": "According to this article, the head teacher is a key success factor at school level, as the instructional head of the school and as the local standards officer ‒ particularly given the scarcity of financial resources to facilitate school visits by standards officers. Additionally, with proper and consistent support, teachers are capable of working with minimum resources and still improve learner performance.The Lesson Study approach is useful and practical as a CPD vehicle to deliver teacher support programs.\n\nFurthermore, teachers feel motivated to engage in Lesson Study and try new approaches in class where they feel their lessons will be monitored by ZICs or DRCCs. In general, schools in rural areas, where staffing levels in subjects like Science and Mathematics are issues, tend to value Lesson Study activities more than those in urban areas. Commitment levels of the DEST and PEST affect the overall implementation of activities in the district and province.\n\nTo improve learner performance it is more effective to provide more direct support and services to zonal and individual schools and school level interventions and innovations are more effective if they are initiated and supported by individuals and groups within the schools or their communities. In addition, use of local resources should be promoted in all schools as instructional materials provided by MoGE HQ will never be adequate to meet the needs of the schools in the foreseeable future.\n\nGiven the inadequate public financing, there is need for innovation and improvisation; to do more with less; to use local resources and develop PPPs. Improved communication and interaction between district education officers, zones and schools/head teachers enhance teacher and learner performance.  And lastly, active and conscious participation of host country counterparts is important in planning, implementation and monitoring of project-supported interventions..\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "The following are examples of key best practices developed to support CPD, as well as lessons learnt; most of those cited below are from the RTS project:\na) Best Practices\ni) CPD projects working through existing Ministry of Education and other relevant government structures, with regard to planning, implementation and monitoring of project interventions.\nii) CPD projects supporting the formulation and operationalisation of enabling policies and frameworks.\niii) Adopting the whole school, whole teacher, whole child approach to enhancing learner performance.\niv) Building the capacity of service providers, including PEST, DEST, ZEST and SEST.\nv) Focusing attention for training and other support on the district, zone and school levels and prioritising school-based CPD.\nvi) Promoting innovative development of locally relevant instructional materials, and using local human and material resources.\nvii) Promoting school-based assessment to support enhancement of teacher and learner performance.\nviii)Promoting cost-effective approaches in training, materials development and service delivery\nix) Promoting evidence-based decision making.\nx) Promoting exchanges among peers so that educators learn from each other.\nxi) Making effective use of innovative ICT technologies to enhance information and knowledge-sharing among educators.\nxii) Promoting school-community partnerships.\nxiii)Promoting mobilisation of supplementary resources through public-private partnerships.\nxiv)Incorporation of sustainability of project objectives and outcomes in the design, planning, implementation and monitoring of project interventions.",

",
      "Key Recommendations": "Learning questions should be revisited periodically; evolution of the learning questions will be reflected in prioritisation of audience and communication channels; which in turn guides communications planning.\n\nIn addition to the learning questions, there needs to be a systematic way for SSD field teams to identify, capture and share the wealth of learning and ideas that SSD implementation work produces.\n\nBy encouraging all staff to reflect often on what they have heard and learnt as they go about their daily implementation work, SSD can encourage a culture of learning and address a gap that was identified by teams in both Benin and Cote d’Ivoire.",

      "Key Findings": "There is some confusion over what is “climate smart” especially for those working close to the farm level and as such, information needs to be easily accessible and usable with better cross-sector collaboration. It is increasingly difficult to balance the need for short-term outcomes and longer-term investment/results.\n\nFurthermore, there is a need to make a business case around climate smart efforts – Cost and ROI are critical for investment decision-making. The report \n\nDepending on the company role as direct service provider, collaborator or catalyst, they have different challenges to investing in climate smart agriculture",
      "Key Recommendations": "Current Needs:\nTo help farmers: \nSimple, uniform messages.\nSpecific practices to address specific problems (also to address currently observed climate change impacts).\n\nFor private sector actors:\nUpdated information in short info briefs, presentations, videos, etc.\nFocusing more on the short-term, but still need to keep awareness raising about the long-term implications of Climate Change (without scaremongering).",

      "Key Findings": "The findings of this review focus in four areas: BPJS-K participation, awareness of and participation in TB programming, the patient pathway, and key opportunities for improving the quality of private sector TB care.\n\nBPJS-K Participation.\nOf the patients interviewed, 85% were enrolled in BPJS-K, and those patients who had coverage were familiar with BPJS-K policies and typically used it to pay for their TB care.\n\nPerspective on TB Guidelines and Programming.\nAmong doctors interviewed, 68% of GPs, 69% of internists, and 80% of pulmonologists said that they are aware of national guidelines regarding TB, and nearly all the remaining interviewees reported that they are at least somewhat aware\n\nPatient Pathway\nThis review was consistent with existing evidence that many people with TB symptoms first seek symptom-relieving care at private pharmacies. When the patients interviewed for this review decided to see a doctor, 65% visited a primary care provider, and 44% of those went to a Pusat Kesehatan Masyarakat (Puskesmas), or community health center.\n\n\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "Throughout this review, potential solutions were informed\nby private sector patient and provider perspectives, as\nwell as input from the NTP, Dinas Kesehatan officials, and\nother stakeholders. The solutions offered are:\n- Regulation is not a sufficient lever to drive behavior\nchange in the private sector.\n- Incentives have the greatest potential to change\nbehavior in the private sector.\n- Solutions for private providers must meet private\nproviders’ needs: they must be targeted, simple, and\nconsistent.\n- Recognize that patients play an important role in their\nown care.\n- Diagnosis is a key point of intervention, and improved\ndiagnostic options are needed, especially in primary\ncare.\n- Increase focus on primary care, both improving quality\nand retaining patients.",

      "Key Findings": "Initial interviews revealed that the cocoa industry was primarily investing in the Sustainable Productivity Pillar of climate-smart agriculture, through their investments in Cocoa Action. Some investment was also happening in small farmer livelihoods through efforts like the Cocoa Livelihood Program and companies’ own sustainability programs. Mitigation of GHG Emissions has only become a core focus of the industry with the recent commitments made to the Cocoa & Forests Initiative, with pledges to preserve standing forests and implement climate smart cocoa on existing farms.\n\nThe CCAFS consortium focused on the third pillar, enabling more investment and action on the Adaptation for Resilience Pillar of CSA.\n\nThe interviews also highlighted two main benefits:\n1. Fostering a shared definition and understanding of climate smart cocoa. Prior to these meetings, there had been varied levels of understanding among company sustainability teams of climate smart cocoa. These meetings helped to clarify the distinction, namely the call to take into account varied vulnerability in different zones, and correspondingly different recommendations for adaptation practices or transformation practices. Based on this shared understanding, companies could act on their new knowledge and customize recommendations by vulnerability zone.\n\n2. Gaining familiarity with climate tools and analytics. Company sustainability teams are stretched thin, often dealing with information overload from all the reports that cross their inboxes. The climate smart cocoa meetings were helpful forums for highlighting the key takeaways of the research and exposing companies to key outputs of the CCAFS work, i.e., the climate suitability maps of the different vulnerability zones and the CSC Manual.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Future directions for USAID:\n1. There is opportunity to increase effectiveness by deepening\ncollaboration with national government, alongside private sector\ncompanies.\n\n2. Companies shared that farmers lack financing options to implement many of the Climate Smart Cocoa (CSC) recommendations.\n\n3. There is need for public investment in Transform Zones.\n",

      "Key Findings": "Typical barriers to private sector investment: A company’s need to deliver short term profits can be a barrier to investment in longer-term climate action, even when it is apparent that it is necessary.\n\nMulti-stakeholder approach: In the case of NBL in Uganda, resilience requires building human, social, financial, natural and physical capital among the farming communities.\n\nCompany characteristics that favor investment in CSA: Companies who already have some knowledge around climate risk are easiest to engage in climate smart agriculture.\n\nEntry points to facilitate investment: By creating lessons that are useful but simple, NGO’s can show the need to adapt for climate resilience.",
      "Key Recommendations": "• Coordinate with Uganda Met and potentially commercial suppliers to install additional weather stations\n• Pursue partnerships with providers of forecasting information allowing dissemination to all providers\n• Support development of enabling environment (e.g. set up co-investment committee with other interested parties such as coffee\ngrowers in Mount Elgon area to develop weather station and communication infrastructure)\n• Invest in further extension activities to help farmers understand need, best use, and see benefit from improved seed\n• Explore partnerships for input-credit model to reach farmers directly or via aggregators",

      "Key Findings": "Not only are NBL’s supply chains complex, they also have incidence of low human, social, financial, natural and physical capital, making them vulnerable to climate change. This article suggests that beyond financial capacity, building resilience will require engagement with other stakeholders. Taking on these challenges will require financial capacity and long-term planning and  Finding a company champion who has the time and influence is crucial to success.\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. The engagement between AB InBev, the Sustainable Food Lab and TechnoServe grew out of long term, trusted relationships.\n\n2. Having a competent implementation partner like TechnoServe, able to both manage local researchers and structure findings for a business audience, was another critical element of success.\n\n3. By creating lessons that were useful but simple, TechnoServe was able to create a better understanding of the need for climate investments.\n\n4. To drive results, companies with long term thinking are more well\nequipped to take on climate-smart agriculture as a way to mitigate risk.",

      "Key Findings": "This cases study finds that In SBR Primary schools and TSS Prep schools, students trained both by “TILO Trained Teachers” and by “TILO Locally Trained teachers” improved significantly in their average midyear marks compared to the baseline. The academic performance of TILO students in both SBR Primary schools and TSS Prep schools showed significant improvement over the course of the intervention as measured by their average mid-year marks. Furthermore, both schools and Idaras significantly increased their use of technology for making data-driven decisions and both teachers’ and students’ perceptions of technology use in the classroom improved significantly over the TILO project.\n\nLastly, while technology was certainly useful to teachers in their teaching, it was clear from the results that the teachers were able to use the technology in appropriate ways because they had first been trained on how to teach well.",
      "Key Recommendations": " Replicate the Student Marks Study in 2014 and 2015 in TILO schools which have not received further interventions in order to see if the impact of the TILO activities have been sustained.\n Include other relevant stakeholders (such as Idara and Muderiya education officers as well as school principals) in interventions involving training of teachers. This makes a big difference in\nterms of securing their buy-in and their engagement during the intervention, as well as their interest in and ability to continue to support the initiatives after the end of the project.\n Consider ways to decentralize decision-making about the allocation of financial and technology resources to ensure the sustainability of TILO interventions.\n Use a phased approach to implementing interventions so that adjustments can be made to address any problems identified in a pilot before the model is rolled out widely.",

      "Key Findings": "One of every four babies born is born in Africa with half of these babies are born at home. It is often the poorest mothers who give birth at home where they are alone and without assistance\nshould complications occur. Meanwhile, half of all child deaths occur in Africa; a total of 6.9 million children died globally in 2011 and about half of these deaths are newborn deaths due mainly to preterm delivery, birth complications and newborn infections. There has been rapid socioeconomic development in many countries in the past decade, but stunting has not diminished (especially in sub-Saharan Africa). The study finds that there are three key determinants for stunting: food security, access to health services, and care of the child.",
      "Key Recommendations": "To accelerate progress we need targeted and effective implementation of high impact interventions.\nDramatic reductions in preventable child deaths can be achieved through concerted action in five critical\nareas, outlined in the Global Roadmap:\n1. Geography: Increase efforts in the areas where the most deaths occur, prioritizing budgets and\ncommitting to action plans to end preventable child deaths.\n2. High Burden Populations: Focus country health systems on scaling-up access for underserved\npopulations, to include rural and low income groups.\n3. High Impact Solutions: Focus on the primary causes of child death.\n4. Gender Equality: Invest beyond health programs to include educating girls and boys,\nempowering women and men, and inclusive economic growth.\n5. Mutual Accountability and Financing: Unify around a shared goal and common metrics.",

      "Key Findings": "The paper found that projects need to consider the value chain as a whole, working with middleman, SME suppliers, processing firms and a portfolio of different buyers (supermarkets, exporters, processing firms and local markets). Partnerships, which create significant shared value, are more likely to be sustained than those anchored purely in public relations-driven CSR while partnerships focused on improving farmer production through capacity building efforts must also be supported by tangible investments. Solutions for financing (for farmers, SMEs, etc) are available and should be included in partnership development. Lastly, every partnership implementation approach should include a sustainability plan that describes a scenario beyond donor involvement and mechanisms for self-replication.",
      "Key Recommendations": "In examining USAID’s experience in developing supermarket partnerships, SSG concludes that the optimal sequence in\nestablishing collaboration should be:\n1. When a public or private actor proposes partnership, determine which local or regional projects would benefit from\ndeeper collaboration with the involved partners, currently or in the future.\n2. Assess the value of pursuing an agreement with the given supermarket chain and decide whether it should be framed\nat the global, regional, or local level.\n3. Develop a list of objectives for the proposed partnership and discuss it with the partner’s CSR and business-related\ndepartments.",

      "Key Findings": "The report's findings are summarized as follows: \n\n• The Landscape of Accelerators: While nearly 75% of all accelerators in our sample rely on some level of philanthropic support, about one-third are structured as for-profits, suggesting that they expect to develop sustainable revenue streams in the future. \n\n• Enterprise Pipeline and Selection: Employment, economic development, health, clean energy, and agriculture are the most common impact areas that accelerators focus on. \n\n• Services and Benefits: The majority of accelerators provide the same set of core services – mentorship, access to investors, networks of partners, and business skills development. \n\n• Accelerator Networks: Accelerators also seek to develop formal partnerships with a range of different types of organizations, including impact investors, commercial investors, foundations,\ngovernments, and universities. \n\n• Metrics and Evaluation: While the majority of accelerators collect financial data, almost one-third do not collect any social performance data. \n\n• Measuring Accelerator Performance: We found that selectivity and partnerships with in-country commercial investors are  associated with higher accelerator performance. ",
      "Key Recommendations": "• Invest in platforms and systems to encourage and enable quality data collection from the enterprises you support,\n• Collect data from all enterprises that apply to your programs, even the ones that are not accepted or do not receive services, to more comprehensively assess performance against a control group.\n• Collect data from participating enterprises for at least five years post-graduation to track progress and growth over the medium to long-term. \n• Partner with academic institutions and industry associations to develop stronger data collection systems.\n• Strengthen your processes for searching and sourcing ventures for your programs.

The importance of engaging the right stakeholders cannot be overstated. It is important to explore options so as to further innovate and so that better solutions can be found; limiting a program to its initial set‐up is not sufficient for achieving the best results.

It is important to also note that several of the problems, as well as successes, during implementation were specific to individuals and, therefore, do not lend themselves to generalization. An example of this is the strength of commitment and leadership qualities of the head nurse at the Rosh Pinah clinic, who gave her personal time and energy to provide support, training, and oversight to the CHVs. Without her leadership and commitment, it is unlikely that the Tutungeni CHVs would have continued.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. As modeled in this project, involve MOHSS Regional Director and Regional Health Management\nteam and community leaders from inception to foster ownership. \n2. Use a community capacity-enhancement approach and facilitation process to stimulate\ncommunity awareness of its own strengths to foster ownership and lead to sustainability.\n3. Start with network and partner mapping to ensure informed decisions and understanding of the\nenvironmental context and presence of other potential partners.\n4. From the CHVs: Be clear about the role and expectations of volunteers from the beginning. \n5. From the CHVs: Foster a team sense of working together for the community.",

Furthermore,  coordination increases when a strategic blueprint is shared across agencies and government-to-government strategies are limited in their ability to attract non-aid actors.",
      "Key Recommendations": "- Bringing U.S. government processes, tools, and incentives up to the task of achieving more sustainable development outcomes by going beyond partnerships to attract investment and engage the core business of companies is the next step. \n\n- More aggressive and innovative development finance tools, targeted capacity building, an expanded project development table that includes potential investors, multi-stakeholder approaches, or contributing to corporate platforms where governments are not in the lead, were suggested as possibilities.\n\n\n\n",

Investment to increase participation of all care providers in TB care and control activities led to an increase in national case finding by private facilities.  Kenya significantly strengthened its laboratory sputum-smear External Quality Assurance (EQA) system.. Coverage increased from 28% to 88% and error rates declined from 14% to 2.8%. With support from TB CARE I, DLTLD is implementing an innovative web based TB program management system integrated with mobile technology—the first of its kind to be implemented in Africa.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. The DLTLD/CRL should empower the EQA officer to dedicate his time for\nEQA activities including data analysis and EQA data quality assessment.\n\n2. There is need to\nestablish a specific task force to oversee and coordinate the GeneXpert MTB/Rif implementation\nand roll out in the country. This team should also coordinate GeneXpert reporting as well as the\nexisting GeneXpert supply management system.\n\n3.  To support the specimen referral system, standard specimen packaging material should be\nprocured and distributed to all the regions in the country.",

There are myriad public and private sector actors involved in health service delivery, with inadequate coordination leading to significant duplication of efforts and there are challenges with sustainability of externally funded health programming along the transport corridor. Lastly, there are existing gaps in research and a need for better  dissemination of program relevant information to stakeholders across the region.",
      "Key Recommendations": "The forum recommends the following actions:\n1. Under the leadership of the East African Community (EAC), establish a Multi‐sectoral Task Force to spearhead strategic action for regional integrated health programming along transport corridors (e.g., mapping, policy review, research agenda);\n2. Building on existing national strategies, develop a regional strategy for integrated, comprehensive health programming along the corridors through an inclusive approach with all key stakeholders (e.g., minimum package of services);\n3. Establish an inclusive Regional Advisory and Oversight Forum within EAC with responsibility for coordinating regional integrated health programming along the transport corridors, regional policy formulation, regional program monitoring, capacity building and technical assistance, regional research, knowledge management, etc.\n4. Develop a specific regional strategy for public‐private sector engagement in integrated health programming along transport corridors.",

      "Key Findings": "Based on the fieldwork and survey results, overall it is clear USG efforts are widely valued across the region, and continue to fill important resource and technical gaps in national HIV/AIDS strategies. In many cases PEPFAR supported activities can be seen as providing otherwise absent leadership and political support for priority efforts focused on KPs, and have contributed significantly to improving capacity and the policy environment in the region. As one of two major external funding sources for HIV/AIDS programs (PEPFAR and the Global Fund), PEPFAR’s contributions have had a major impact in the region, including strengthening of STI services targeting key populations, and the institutionalization and strengthening of key implementing and decision-making structures such as the National AIDS Councils (NACs) and the ‘Three Ones’, while also providing direct and targeted support to priority program areas. In general, the quality of technical assistance delivered through the four USG agencies and their partners is highly valued within the spheres they work in, but there is a perception of poor coordination and sharing of information across the agencies and with their partners.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Key recommendations include moving towards a vulnerability approach in addition to a risk approach to address the larger barriers such as stigma and discrimination that make key populations vulnerable in the first place. PEPFAR should focus efforts on sustainability for KP\nprevention and the promotion of public and other funding streams in light of reduced donor funding in the future. To address the challenges of human resources and weak health systems, PEPFAR should increase emphasis on building institutional capacity to ensure improvements\nmade to date are not lost. PEPFAR should support countries to improve capacity for research and continue to strengthen ability to produce and use information through harmonization of systems and indicators.",

      "Key Findings": "The findings from the study can broadly be divided into four: \n\n• Policy Symbiosis\nDespite much of the “limited government” rhetoric found in some impact investing discussions, government has been a critical player in both financing the field and creating a supportive regulatory environment within which the best funds prosper.\n\n• Catalytic Capital\nThe most successful impact investing funds understand the role of Catalytic Capital as critical not only for financial, but also strategic reasons.\n\n• Multilingual Leadership \nThere is an evolving myth that financial skills alone are the key to successful impact investing, but our research shows that impact funds managed by those with financial discipline combined with skills from the public, non-profit, and related sectors (e.g. development finance) were best positioned both to generate financial returns and create social/environmental value.\n\n• Mission First and Last\nIn the 1.0 era, impact investors were encouraged to present themselves as being either “Financial-first” or “Impact-First.” ",
      "Key Recommendations": "Given, then, that impact investing will continue to grow and\nevolve, what are the fundamental questions we should consider\nin years to come? We start with this initial set:\n■ Which of these four trends will still be true 10 or 20 years\nfrom now?\n■ What percentage of the market will remain closely tied\nto policy and Catalytic Capital? Will the responsibility of\ninstitutional alignment come to be seen as commonplace\nin a holistic approach to capital market development and\noperations?\n■ Will Multilingual Leadership get easier as more talent enters\nthe field? Or will the field become more specialized and the experience sets more distinct?",

      "Key Findings": "The climate change projections, which can be seen as the exposure component of vulnerability to climate change, provided a clear message of increasing temperatures, yet a more complicated message when it comes to rainfall and river discharge. The article states that all livelihood strategies assessed (tourism, commercial farming, communal farming, natural resource harvesting), with the exception of mining, were found to be sensitive to the possible impacts of climate change. The socioeconomic impacts that were identified showed communal farming as the livelihood with the greatest sensitivity to climate change.\n\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "- In summary, the assessment established that sustainable management of the Okavango Basin should be a key priority to ensure a sound and functioning ecosystem that supports sustainable livelihoods and is resilient to climate variability and change.\n\n- While the system has a considerable degree of resilience, the increased pressures and challenges for the ecosystem, such as increased development, mining, irrigation schemes, and veterinary fencing, require a coordinated approach. With resilience maintained over time, the Okavango River Basin will be in a better position to cope with and absorb some level of climate variability and change.\n\n- While a coordinated Basin-wide response is important, it is also crucial to support further capacity development on the national and local levels to prepare for and respond to more unpredictable weather patterns that may affect natural and socioeconomic systems. \n",

      "Key Findings": "Critically, the RATE Opportunities for Action are grounded in an awareness there are many pathways to change. Within the ASEAN region, important reforms can be moved forward by a single, visionary champion or a by groundswell of stakeholders. In most cases, a “big idea” —including the type that is often promoted by regional or international organizations such as ASEAN, the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, the World Economic Forum, and others—can be broken down into many smaller tasks, which, again, can be seized by a variety of public and private actors. Accordingly, the Opportunities for Action found in the topic reports are intended to be multifaceted. Against a backdrop of dramatic change across ASEAN in recent years, the RATE deliverables are intended to serve as useful inputs to an environment of informed and inclusive long-term growth.",

      "Key Findings": "Feed the Future's work in Ethiopia in FY2014 accounts for fact that more than 217,600 farmers and other producers applied new technologies and practices for the first time with Feed the Future's help. Producers also applied improved technologies and management practices on more than 90,800 hectares of land with Feed the Future's help. Feed the Future-supported farmers and producers increased the value of their agricultural product sales by more than $45.6 million while Feed the Future leveraged more than $27.49 million in new private investment in food and agriculture in Ethiopia. The U.S. Government programs reached more than 1.3 million children under 5 across Ethiopia to improve their nutrition.\n\nEthiopia, supported by Feed the Future and private sector partners, introduced the first locally-fortified wheat flour in the country while the program also helped Ethiopia establish its first blended fertilizer production facility and the first camel milk processing center, with demand for additional centers. USAID's Food for Peace environmental rehabilitation activities also restored more than 20,000 hectares of land, which will improve households' resilience to the effects and pressure of climate change. Ethiopia experienced a 40 percent increase in the value of livestock in pastoral dryland areas targeted by Feed the Future livestock value chain programs and partners helped facilitate more than $10 million in private sector investment into pastoralist dryland areas targeted by livestock value chain and other Feed the Future supported programs.",

      "Key Findings": "With this case study can understand that community level, there is great untapped interest in participating in health and development programming and in developing appropriate skills.\nIn addition, in under-served corridor communities, educational and literacy levels are generally low, requiring development of appropriate tools and materials. Initial community expectation often revolves around ‘hand-outs’; this learning process is continual and requires sensitivity in initial mobilization and sensitization activities. Economic Strengthening programming requires careful planning with other programming components so as to provide consistent messages about expectations from the project. And it is clear that households frequently need ongoing support rather than one-off activities to change behaviors.\n\nRegarding the FP/RH and GBV Program, the study points that Conducting baseline assessment on KAP in community and facility prior to program design is critical in addressing/targeting gaps identified thus contributing to effective systems strengthening and use of resources. Recruitment and deployment of dedicated FP/RH Technical Officers ensures effective and efficient implementation of activities and collaboration with partners, MoH, CBOS, NGOs etc.  Availability of basic or adequate equipment, materials and supplies at facilities increases the use and quality of services (feedback from MoH in participating countries).\n\nIn terms of alcohol/substance abuse, the study found that due to the profile of ROADS II sites, brewing and selling local alcohol is a thriving business, and therefore to make ends meet, many low income women are involved in this business. To address this, project beneficiaries were encouraged to get involved in ROADS II economic strengthening activities which provide three levels of livelihoods support; 1) mobilizing financial safety nets through savings (GSLA); 2) maximizing household production; and 3) increasing market readiness. Lastly, facilitating platforms for disparate audiences to meet and discuss difficult, even taboo subjects in a neutral environment can initiate a process of constructive engagement and joint activity, such as bringing together police and female sex workers to discuss issues around GBV. However, building trust for sensitive community dialogue can be time-consuming and requires skilled facilitators.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Recommendations\nCross-cutting\n1. There is need to improve acquisition and distribution of IEC materials because this plays a significant role in educating and influencing behavior change among the mobile populations.\n2. There is high demand for Alcohol/GBV risk prevention interventions in the community following mobilization and formation of Community Alcohol Support Groups and task forces. Formation of these groups should therefore be replicated in other ROADS sites and countries.\n\n\nFP/RH and MNCH\n1. Urgent need to conduct training for FP providers in the public and private sectors in sites that FP/RH adoption is slow. This includes the drug shop owners and health care providers in the government owned health units. There are glaring gaps in the knowledge levels for the providers especially in the mid- and long-term contraceptive methods.\n2. There is an urgent need to improve the infrastructure of health facilities in some sites/countries to improve privacy while conducting FP/GBV services.\n\nEconomic Strengthening\n1. ES programmes should specifically target households with orphans or adopted children living within, as an indicator of vulnerable households, and link any ES intervention to child-level outcomes. OVC household populations could be targeted for sensitization on Economic Strengthening interventions, and then allow self-selection into the intervention by individual households.\n2. GSLA alone cannot be hailed as the single financial service acting as a change agent in the household economy but as a critical starting point to use of more formal financial services. Whilst accepting the value respondents see in pulling on GSLA resources as a response to seasonal shocks, programs should\ncontinue to encourage the use of these resources for productive, more than for consumption uses for loans thereby derived.",

      "Key Findings": "There is a need to empower entrepreneurs as individuals and invest in the whole person: entrepreneur, head of household, community reference point and potential leader. We need to understand and work within the entrepreneurs’ incentive structures, leverage relationships of trust, facilitate experiential learning and find an appropriate balance between reach and impact. To strengthen broader business ecosystems, prioritize challenges to address, understand stakeholder incentives and institutional capacity, seek the support of catalysts where necessary to unlock action. Finally,  integration with core business operations requires a effort to create measurable value for the business and for society, cultivate country-level ownership with corporate level leadership and support, provide flexibility for countries to customize and build upon the common core program.\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "Companies can:\n1. Focus on small businesses that are already part of their value chains or have the potential to become part. \n2. Combine core business operations and corporate social investment.\n3. Identify and enlist champions across the organization.\n4. Set clear objectives both for the number of small businesses to be reached and for the impact to be achieved.\n5. Evaluate the business case, calculating financial returns on investment wherever possible in addition to capturing other non-financial benefits.\n6.

Lessons learned and policy recommendations will enable a legal framework to support long term implementation. Scaling up of PES innovation will also benefit other countries in Southeast Asia, such as Laos, through study tour exchanges and sharing lessons learned via the regional platform.",

      "Document Title": "The Dynamics of Employment Growth",
      "Key Findings": "This report has provided a detailed description of the on-going distributed micro-data analysis project called DynEmp aimed at understanding employment dynamics and also presented a preliminary set of results. First, the analysis showed significant cross-country differences not only in the weight that small firms have in terms of employment, but also in their age profile, e.g. in some countries, small firms are systematically older. Second, it has been carefully documented that the group of young firms, i.e. firms that are five years of age or younger, contribute positively to aggregate job creation in nearly every period and country considered. This was shown to be driven to a large extent by the contribution from entrants as well as higher growth rates of surviving young businesses.\n\nThird, there is evidence of a clear decline in start-up rates found across a wide set of countries and the existence of an “up-or-out” dynamic for young businesses. Fourth, the analysis provides evidence on the growth performance of young firms, showing again striking cross-country differences in the data. Fifth, the report shows that young firms were relatively more affected by the Great Recession compared to old ones, both via job creation and via job destruction. However, the main drivers of the aggregate decline in employment were old firms, given their larger weight in the economy. Moreover, the contribution to net employment growth of young firms remained positive during\nthe crisis.\nAnd, finally, during the Great Recession there has been a further decrease in the entry rate of new firms, which was already steadily declining in most countries since the beginning of the last decade. Given the importance of firm entry on a host of economic outcomes beyond job creation (e.g. innovation, competition, productivity) this finding raises particular concerns.",
      "Key Recommendations": "-  Going forward, the aim of further analyses are, on the one hand, to link the observed cross-country differences in firms’ dynamism to national policies and framework conditions, affecting entrepreneurship, experimentation and the growth of firms.\n\n- This will rely on the second phase of the data collection DynEmp\nv2, with more detailed industry breakdowns, as well as having a closer look on high-growth enterprises.\n\n- On the other hand, in order to gain a better understanding of the link between employment dynamics and economic growth and productivity, a parallel analysis and data collection is planned, called MultiProd, collecting micro-aggregated data on output and productivity, in a similar manner to DynEmp.\n\n- This will allow the subsequent analysis to shed light on questions such as what drives productivity differences at the\naggregate level, why some countries are better at allocating resources to more productive firms than others, and what is the role of policies in achieving better outcomes both in terms of productivity and of employment.",

This will keep your deep dives focused and relevant.\n\nTo simplify the research process, narrow down your focus on the most interesting regions for deeper probing. Identify major characteristic differences or redundancies between areas and make an informed decision to whether or not to include the area for further probing.\n\nAfter your deep dives, consolidate your findings into a PowerPoint-style report with raw data and visuals. Don’t forget to take pictures!\n\nBe specific on the details as you share stories – focusing on what precisely market actors said in their experiences and perceptions is critical to avoid letting the team’s biases into the research and analysis",

      "Key Findings": "In general, the proposed waste code, as defined by the June 16, 2014 draft, will provide a meaningful legal framework by which to undertake planning for effective solid waste management programs throughout Georgia. However, there is considerable work to be done given the current state of solid waste management in Georgia and the improvements required to achieve the desired outcomes of the new waste code. The finalization of a national strategy as well as the development of national and municipal SWM plans will be important in establishing the actual roadmap to be followed in achieving the necessary improvements. Fortunately, the Association Agreement, in addition to its stipulated mandates, also provides an opportunity to learn from the experiences gained in other countries who have worked towards improving their solid waste management programs to E.U. standards. These experiences will be valuable both in planning as well as the physical implementation of alternative approaches that are technically and economically viable.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. The Ministry should undertake a detailed assessment of existing solid waste management practices and facilities throughout Georgia to serve as a baseline for establishing its overall national strategy and plan and, ultimately, measuring national (as well as regional and municipal) progress in achieving the intent of the new waste code.\n\n2. The Ministry should develop or support a comprehensive public awareness and education program concerning the basis of the proposed waste code and the need to improve SWM services and\nfacilities. \n\n3. The Ministry should undertake a detailed assessment of the cost implications of the proposed outcomes of the new waste code as a basis for effective economic resource planning and the development of the national strategy and plan as well as for development of subsequent municipal SWM plans. \n\n4. Since in the waste code will apply to all municipalities throughout Georgia, the ministry should develop or support a program to increase the technical and managerial capacity of municipal\nofficials that will be responsible for developing local SWM plans and implementing the processes and facilities that are required to comply to the intent of the new waste code.\n\n5. The proposed sub‐law on hazardous waste should be as specific as possible in defining the manner by which waste materials would be classified as either hazardous and nonhazardous along with the\nprocess that will be utilized by the government in assuring and enforcing compliance.

      "Document Title": "Analysis of USAID/Colombia’s Public-Private Partnerships",
      "Key Findings": "The private sector’s main incentive to join USAID in post-conflict zones is, not surprisingly, to pursue business opportunities such as those shown in Figure 3. USAID has focused much PPP effort on connecting local producers with large commercializing companies. This approach has resulted in short-term successes, with low risk. Generally these efforts involve local associations and private companies who have previously worked with USAID programs such as MIDAS.\n\nPPPs have also been used to reach development goals beyond economic growth for its own sake. Costs, timelines, and other challenges are generally greater, but when the development benefits are deemed important, these can be useful PPPs. One such set of\nUSAID/Colombia efforts (key to this analysis) targets the reintegration of ex-combatants. The research found that large companies are reluctant to hire ex-combatants, though SMEs at times find it worthwhile, with the right incentives. But the logic behind other PPPs – of helping many under one scheme – may not be applicable to these varied and highly vulnerable groups.\n\nPPPs have served to increase beneficiaries’ licit incomes, particularly in the short term but with good prospects for mid- and long-term economic gains as well. Success in these outcomes depends on a proper combination of short- and long-term income solutions for\nvulnerable beneficiaries. Other benefits are social and familial, particularly where these benefits are explicitly sought.\n\nThe analysis concludes that successful and expanding PPPs are\nlargely based on the interaction of trustworthy private partners and strengthened beneficiaries, in a context that offers competitive advantages and a set of minimum contextual conditions for doing businesses. The team did not find any relation between the magnitude of the private sector financial contribution and PPP sustainability. The reputation of the private company, however, is critical to building trust and commitment from targeted populations.\n\nUSAID has a symbiotic relationship with several programs of the GOC in\nimplementing PPPs. CELI coordinates with the PAP of the Ministry Agriculture, CORE coordinates with ACR, and ACIP works closely with the Productive Transformation Program (PTP) of the Ministry of Commerce. On the other hand, in spite of USAID efforts toward improving local business conditions, the private sector remains highly distrustful of local governments. These have a reputation for being weak and for lacking interest in providing technical support to beneficiaries. Many actors believe that incorporating local governments in PPPs may even reduce the chances of sustainability.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. Strategic approach\nUSAID has had significant successes with many PPPs by taking advantage of opportunities that\narise to link small producers with markets. USAID’s good name ensures that potential partners\nwill participate, even incurring some risk, in order to potentially gain through expanded value\nchains. However, some of the purely development goals the Mission seeks will remain out of\nreach under this model, as described below.\nThe Mission will need to take a more active role in securing alliances outside its most prevalent\n\nmodel, focusing on geographic and thematic areas that can more directly target particular post-\nconflict benefits. To reach these goals, the analysis recommends a strategy focused on three\n\nsteps: 1) identification of opportunities; 2) development of business plans and 3) promotion and\nstrengthening activities.\nA. Identification of Business Opportunities\nThe identification of business opportunities in transitional zones requires the following:\n• A comprehensive assessment of the agricultural products or raw materials that are lacking\nin Colombia and that could be produced by each conflict-affected region;\n• An inventory of the production capabilities that these regions offer, including an analysis\nof the reduction of agricultural production as a result of internal displacement, the\noutlook for land that will be made accessible after conflict (i.e. natural parks, mining and\nenergy production) and the abandoned infrastructure that can still be recovered; and\n• A market study that identifies the changes in demand for goods and services by the\ninhabitants of such emerging markets, and the companies likely to fill these needs.\nB. Development of business plans\nBusiness plans should prioritize PPPs associated with productive sectors with high potential.\nCriteria for selecting sectors may follow existing GOC criteria (e.g., the “World Class sectors”\nidentified by the Ministry of Commerce in its PTP.) As these alliances will likely be with\npartners that are less experienced with such activities, and with more, smaller partners, greater\n\ntechnical assistance (TA) will likely be required. Identifying opportunities for integrating ex-\ncombatants will require that USAID move away from the models of large numbers per project, in\n\norder to seize opportunities at a micro level. This includes understanding the employment needs\nof SMEs and exploring opportunities to support ex-combatants’ own value chain\nentrepreneurship, individually and in small associations.\nC. Promotion activities\nDeveloping business plans and promoting new investments among the private sector will require\ntechnical resources that USAID does not currently have. At present, USAID’s programs are\ndesigned to prioritize strengthening and linking local producers in supply chains. It will be\nnecessary to evaluate whether an additional program should undertake investment banking and\nincubator-type activities, including the formulation of business plans and the promotion of\ninvestment among those opportunities identified by the Mission.\nD. Strengthening activities\nActivities should build upon USAID’s successful approaches to strengthening producer\nassociations and other beneficiaries’ employment and entrepreneurship skills. It also may require\ncomplementing existing governance and consolidation efforts with a national good governance\ninitiative. This initiative could be focused in strengthening transparency and efficiency of the\nGOC for improving infrastructure and access to social services in post-conflict regions.\nA critical line of action is related to local governance strengthening programs in post-conflict\nregions: to create enabling environments for business, it will be necessary improve transparency\nand accountability of local governments, and to construct greater capacity to advocate for\ninfrastructure and social services resources.\n2. Diversify approach to different types of companies for PPPs targeting reintegration\nStigmatization, lack of social and technical skills and illegality should be taken into account\nwhen PPPs are designed to offer economic opportunities for ex-combatants. Businesses will\nexpect that ex-combatants will receive ongoing psychological and vocational support from\nUSAID and GOC, beyond their entrance to PPPs.\nBusiness motivations to participate in PPPs to provide economic opportunities to ex-combatants\ndepend on the size of the company and its corporate responsibility agenda. Possible approaches\nto diversify USAID’s approach include:\n• Because SMEs are more likely to hire ex-combatants, develop a model tailored for these\ncompanies, starting with market research on the SMEs’ needs for personnel and financial\nand technical support. Accompany activities with outreach and communications\nstrategies targeting SMEs.\n• Encourage large Colombian companies to procure goods and services from SMEs that\nemploy demobilized combatants. One example would be proposing that Ecopetrol and\nPacific Rubiales give preferential scoring to proposals from SMEs that employ\ndemobilized combatants. This does not require disclosure of ex-combatants’ names.\nRather, companies that certify that a portion of their permanent staff comes from this\npopulation could simply be given preferential scoring. This approach is used by the GOC,\nwhich awards additional points to those companies hiring ethnic minorities and disabled\npopulations.\n• Identify other, less capital-intensive income generation alternatives for ex-combatants.\nSuch alternatives may include vocational or entrepreneurial training for self-employment,\nor opportunities with supported small- and medium-sized enterprises.\n3. Define integral change as the goal for beneficiaries\nUSAID’s main target is to improve living conditions of beneficiaries. However, success is\nmeasured through ‘hard indicators’ such as income and employment generation. This can leave\nother significant dimensions of change outside of the approach and measurement. Some ideas for\nencouraging implementing partners to pursue a more integrated approach to beneficiaries are:\n• Target not only individuals but also families through complementary programs to access\nsocial services such as education for children and women; access to psycho-social and\nsexual and reproductive health services; and formalization of property.\n• Strategically promote income generation in short-, medium- and long-term approaches.\nMost projects visited focused on long-term yield activities. Consider expanding PPPs that\nprovide short-term income (i.e. using existing underutilized capacities and short yield\ncrops), and exploring side-businesses for other family members to permit immediate\nincome to the household (i.e. training and self-employment for spouses and youth).\n• Complement existing indicators with those that help track changes in living conditions.\n4. Improve MONITOR to track standard variables.\nUSAID/Colombia’s has introduced important improvements in its monitoring data storage\nsystem (MONITOR). The Mission will need to ensure considerable follow-up on implementer\ncompliance, and that the guidelines allow for the use of the data for decision-making.\nIn order to better assess PPPs in light of the ‘function of success’ described above, the Mission\nshould consider developing indicators that allow tracking other important dimensions, such as:\n• Productive sector of the PPP, and product and service produced by the PPP.\n• Data on the private sector partner (i.e. size, sector(s), years of existence, etc.) and\ncontact information for more than one team member.\n• Data on local partners (i.e. association, community council, individuals, etc.),\nincluding previous participation with GOC or international donors.\n• Contribution by partner (i.e. financial contribution, types and estimated values of\nin-kind contributions, types of TA).\n• Defining if the PPP is new, expanding or replicating a previous project.\n• Training implementing partners in Data Quality Analysis\n\nThe Mission should be using MONITOR data to track those PPP aspects that show more\npromising outcomes, and looking for successful combinations. A mutually agreed new set of\nreports could help the Mission’s decision-making process. Clear data requirements, follow-up\nand use of the data for decision-making are essential for such a significant investment from\nUSAID. An initial set of indicator categories is presented in Annex 11.",

      "Key Findings": "The Borderless Alliance, even though relatively young, is already starting to generate a tangible impact on-the-ground in facilitating intra-regional and cross-border trade in West Africa. It has already achieved significant results in reducing bribes along road corridors, and up to a 50% reduction in port processing time (achieved by reducing the number of checkpoints along the corridor). As stakeholders continue to build upon increasing efficiencies, all core report recommendations made in 2012 (in the Lome-Ouagadougou Transport and Logistics Cost study) have been implemented. Since its establishment, the Borderless Alliance campaign advocacy methods and USAID Trade Hub-supported private-sector coalition to increase trade have leveraged significant transport efficiency impacts behind and on the border. Ultimately, it has created a platform for private sector engagement in the sub-regional trade policy-making process; and provided significant business networking opportunities which have encouraged intensification of intra-West African trade and investment flows.",
      "Key Recommendations": "The success of the WATH-supported Borderless Alliance in decreasing time and cost to trade in West Africa offers several lessons for future Hub initiatives.\n\n- First, intensive ongoing stakeholder engagement is fundamental to effectively addressing the formidable challenges posed by NTBs in a systemic manner.\n\n- Second, programs that publish data showing trade inefficiencies can be used to pressure policymakers to adopt business-friendly policies. Such programs are relatively inexpensive and effective ways to decrease the prevalence of bribes.\n\n- Finally, when programs have the support of the public and private sectors and show measurable results, they can be self-sustaining.",

Although the change of rules in relation to the area of intervention was not initially accepted, none of the project partners withdrew. In the same way, some felt that the project intervention strategy did not consider the business interests of the private sector. Most corporate partners showed there was not much interest to participate in specific topics such as HIV/AIDS and Sexual and Reproductive Health (SRH), in some cases due to cultural factors or lack of knowledge or experience in handling these topics. \n\nRegarding relations with current governments, most of the stakeholders consulted stated that these were developed according to the level of confidence of the private sector with government officials and especially the health and education portfolios. With regard to best practices and significant changes, all stakeholders consulted recognized\nthe high value on the principle of leverage (2:1), although some would have liked this to be reduced to 1:1. The technical support received is also recognized, especially in the areas of management and accountability, the possibility of having a common agenda (thematic an \npriority areas), and the slight achievements in the transition from a strictly philanthropic approach to more strategic approach to the problems identified. With these and other elements, those interviewed agree to assign a high value to the idea of public-private partnerships, especially with regard to nationwide priority issues (common agenda), but aligned to public policy.\n\nAs for the factors of obstacles and challenges, most referred to the contents of Modification 15, especially with regard to the change in geographical area, the reduction of the budget and in the case of NGOs the obligation to become a corporate partner. As indicated in the\ndocument, this is because they prefer to intervene in their area of influence and business interests. The goal of a 2:1 leverage ratio presented a challenge throughout the project period. At the same time, those interviewed still point to the excessive bureaucracy (procedures and controls), but also recognize it as a great added value to their institutions. In this component, cultural factors are again noted as a challenge for the implementation of programs on issues such as sexual and reproductive health and HIV.\nOther challenges mentioned refer to the lack of coordination between USAID programs, lack of contact between implementing partners with businesses, RTI staff turnover, and little specialized technical support received in the areas of health and education, as well as poor\ncommunication, information and disclosure of the nature, objectives, strategies and successes of the project. With respect to sustainability, most stakeholders consulted noted, and highly appreciated, having had a reliable facilitating agency with local staff. Furthermore, success was found responding to the most sensitive social needs of Guatemala, as actors from various sectors were more eager to become involved. At the same time, CentraRSE, United Way and FUNDESA, should be considered as potential successors to the Project. In summary, a great contribution (added value) of the Project experience in its second phase\nin Guatemala is the following: to have been able to attract the attention and interest of the private sector to team in leveraging resources for investment in health and education This because on one hand, the ability to manage and present a portfolio with an agenda, topics,\nactors and strategic areas that formerly appeared in a scattered and disjointed manner ensured the strengthening of capabilities in the areas of management, administration and accountability. All this experience influences the private sector, which is experiencing an incipient change in mindset to move from a system based on philanthropy, to a strategic approach that guarantees a greater impact on issues affecting regions and disadvantaged populations in the country.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Addressing the relevance and consistency of the Project, those consulted believe that in a future similar experience, the component related to the strategic vision and sustainability of\ninterventions should be subject to a political agreement between donors, key stakeholders, society, and government. Similarly, the Project should continue to promote and strengthen Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), ensuring that the private sector goes beyond the area of influence (employees and geographical area of direct intervention) to invest in issues on the national level in other priority areas and outside its area of influence and business interests.\nFurthermore, it is suggested that the entity that fills the role of RTI in the future becomes a facilitator and integrator of priorities and priority interventions in health and education (targeted strategy), to allow the private sector to invest in health and education in ways that align with their particular interests. To accomplish this, a sufficiently representative governance structure is necessary that incorporates the political/strategic levels, actors of high national influence, and advisory committees to support implementation. Given these obstacles and challenges, most stakeholders recommend that the partner status be respected, to review and make more flexible instruments and processes, ensure\ncompliance with agreed upon timelines and a staff of specialists to support in priority areas to be defined. All this, coupled with an efficient communication, advocacy and outreach strategy, as well as strengthening the political-strategic level with the participation of other donors, civil society, government, the Academy and Thought Centers to improve vision and orientation interventions.\n\n\nFinally, when considering a future intervention with the public-private partnerships approach, respondents recommended that USAID partners maintain their political and strategic role, continuing the Project with some political and strategic innovations arising from this evaluation, maintaining the policy of not delivering funding to the government, and to develop \"added value\" in partners. They also suggest evaluating the possibility of\ntransferring the strategy or method of multi-sector alliances to one of three consortium mentioned. These consortium have greater potential to exercise that role and incorporate other donors and stakeholders in Guatemalan society, as well to include an M&E system to measure and disclose the performance and impact of projects, to define a strategy and to assign a person to manage the relationship between Civil Society, Public and Private Sectors.",

The policy, regulatory, institutional capacity and infrastructure to support efficient national power grids are seriously deficient in the three poorest members of the LMS (Cambodia, Burma and Lao PDR), most well-developed in Thailand and partially developed in Vietnam. Lastly, solar PV and small hydro energy resources are the most ubiquitous and combined solar/small hydro projects could provide reliable electricity supplies for villages and small towns.",
      "Key Recommendations": "- Power trading refers to large scale trades from surplus providers to markets where power demand exceeds local supplies. USAID could bring a comparative advantage of experience to the requirements for setting up trading between excess and deficient power producers or support initiatives being undertaken by other donors.\n\n- USAID could provide business development training for energy service companies ESCOs and work with the Funds to develop project appraisal, due diligence, and transparency measures, where required and support monitoring and evaluation of the Funds’ performance.\n- Continued support for the Asia Clean Energy Forum as an important knowledge exchange vehicle is a very cost effective way of building or supporting regional and broader international partnerships.",

      "Document Title": "Strengthening Public Financial Management in Latin America and the Caribbean: Final Training Needs Assessment Report for Paraguay's Ministry of Hacienda",
      "Key Findings": "Qualitative data was collected and analyzed for trends, similarities and differences in stakeholders’ responses. Below are the key qualitative data findings, organized by stakeholder group for ease of\nreview:\n\n1.3.1 MANAGEMENT MEETINGS\n\nMH Budget and Public Investment Management Departments\n• Department of Budget (DGP) and Department of Public Investment (DSIP) senior management are overly committed to planning and budgeting reform, but often feel stretched thin with many\nsimultaneous and heavy job responsibilities.\n• DGP and DSIP management conveyed on the need to simplify and associate with other secondary legislation and regulatory framework in one organic budget law with a view to create an integrated financial management system that is clear within all its main wings and inter linkages.\n• Lack of a unified institutional framework and financial management structure that clearly establishes the main financial management functions and processes across the Government.\n• DGP personnel spend a disproportionate amount of time in processing of in-year budget adjustment requests from MDAs, often diverting them from technical matters such as monitoring and evaluation. Time resources could be used more efficiently if the administrative processes and procedures were simplified and automated.\n• Lacking of planning and budgeting manuals or Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) specific to the needs of every MDA requires the DGP and DSIP personnel to spend substantive amount of time in providing lead advice and technical guidance to line management’s finance and administration officials.\n• There are limited training avenues for DGP and DSIP employees for such a broad spectrum of planning and budgeting competencies, and staff often does not understand their role in the overall PFM architecture.\n• Coordination with other relevant external stakeholders that serve the DGP and DSIP, (i.e., Civil Service, Public Procurement, Planning Secretariat), is a weakness.\n• There is limited availability of relevant data, such as fixed asset financial information for DGP and DSIP to make informed budget decisions.\n• Management welcome efforts to strengthen planning and budgeting capacities to make reforms sustainable.\n\nLine Ministry Management\n• Line Ministry management was not involved in the PFM Reform Action Plan 2012-2015 and as such the reform dialogue and sensitization with MH is weak. Moreover, communication pertaining to\nreforms and other relating events in budgeting and other PFM generally weak across Government.\n• Existing regulatory framework is very complex, and has grown hastily over the years, fragmented in various other pieces outside the Finance Administration Law (LAFE), thus resulting in data processing and exchange between processes and key units difficult, which often results in duplication of efforts.\n• Documentation of reform lessons, institutional record of training within most prolific Line Ministry is gone (i.e., Ministry of Public Works).\n• The roles and responsibilities of planning and budgeting functions are unclear, and often the communication between the different budget offices within the Line Ministries is limited to non-existent.\n• There is a serious disconnect between the various relevant directorate general units (i.e., Directorate General (DG) Finance and Administration, DG Public Purchases, DG Human Resources, DG Planning) and their respective subordinate cells, often creating duplication of tasks and staffing.\n• Line ministries often lack proper budget management tools and systems, resulting in routine work cumbersome and inefficient.\n• There is a culture of high staff turnover which limits the institutional record and documentation of reform lessons. Management is very concerned about the lack of institutional capacity that is retained\nin their organizations, particularly in budgeting. Due to high turnover, trained personnel do not stay on the job long enough to train other colleagues, or are very limited in number.\n\n1.3.2 HUMAN RESOURCES MANAGEMENT MEETINGS\n• The MH Human Resources Coordination Department is understaffed in accordance to international best practices.\n• Jobs are posted internally and externally on the Secretariat of Public Functions (SFP) website and the ministry websites. SFP manages the recruitment process with input from the ministries.\n• The MH and LM have a different protocol for conducting the annual TNA as well as preparation of their annual Training Plan. The MH Training Plan focuses heavily on sourcing external free training versus designing, developing and delivering internal training. The annual training budget varies from across MH and LMs.\n• Currently, MH and LM do not have a protocol for training, developing and promoting staff given concern over how to implement the Law of Public Servants. There is a protocol for how staff apply and get accepted for external training. However, it is different in each organization.\n• The MH and LM have a different protocols and forms for the annual review process. Not all employees complete their annual performance appraisal.\n• Compensation is based on title and the amount of education and training but pay scales vary by ministry.\n\n1.3.3 INSTRUCTOR MEETINGS\n\n• Potential MH instructors are qualified in their respective areas of management, instruction, technical expertise among other functions and competencies and have a solid understanding of their respective\nroles and responsibilities.\n• Many MH instructors also teach to supplement their full-time work in various MH units. None of the instructors went through a competitive selection to be an instructor. Instead, they were “nominated” because of their expertise and years of experience in budgeting and other relevant technical areas.\n• Instructors interviewed have worked or have strong experience as instructor in key fields considered critical and relevant to planning and budgeting such as the financial regulatory framework, financial planning and programming.\n• None of the MH instructors have experienced at a Training of Trainers (TOT) program but one had a positive learning in 2008 from one TOT program at Curitiba/Brazil with the aim of replicating the TOT experience in Paraguay, which never consummated.\n• All instructors felt that they would benefit from more training on how to effectively develop and deliver courses. Furthermore, all interviewed instructors indicated that they would like to become trainers to\nlearn more and teach on other fields relevant to their budgeting or planning job duties.\n• All instructors agreed they do not receive guidance on developing and delivering a course to training participants. Instead, instructors are supplied with generic training materials, (i.e., United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America - UN/CEPAL), core materials in monitoring and evaluation, not adapted to the specific sector-by-sector training needs.\n• All responded the existing regulatory framework and institutional bottlenecks being challenge factors to the strengthening of technical capacities within PFM in Paraguay.\n1.3.4 INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT PARTNERS\n\n• Budgeting trainings provided by International Development Partners (IDPs) are often one-off efforts that are project-focused and are not well coordinated.\n• IDP-funded budget reform efforts with associated trainings are particularly focused on project management and monitoring and  evaluation, often seen too advanced, and are not articulated with\nother relating training within MH.\n• Current technical assistance that is underway by the two IDPs is highly relevant to the PFM-LAC Project in Paraguay, and there is opportunity for establishing lines of coordination and collaboration.\n• The Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) agreed with DGP in prioritizing and streamlining of core competencies of planning and budgeting to training plans.\n1.3.5 BUDGET COMPETENCY SURVEY\n\n• Common themes among MH and LM survey respondents included improving the budgeting legal framework, enacting participatory budgeting, grounding assumptions in realistic operating plans, and\nproviding various levels of training to all employees in budgeting competencies and processes.\n\n1.3.6 INSTITUTION CAPACITY SURVEY\n\nMH staff shared:• Their work is important because it is focused on the effective management of public funds and the ability to provide transparency in public administration.\n• The easiest part of their job was working with their team members.\n• Salaries were low and that a lack of career planning has led to low morale among employees and high turnover.\n• Desire additional training open to all employees in technical areas relevant to their jobs.\n• To improve their work environment, staff indicated that they would appreciate improved infrastructure, physical space, and IT software and systems.\n\n1.3.7 MH TRAINING COMMITTEE\n\n• A Training Committee exists within MH that has a protocol for how staff apply for external training opportunities. The Training Committee was established in 2010 with a Training Resolution Act. The protocol identifies the committee members and the criteria for participant training evaluation.\n\n1.3.8 TRAINING FACILITIES\n\n• None of the existing MH training facilities meet international best training practices. They are primarily designed for lectures instead of highly interactive adult training. Several rooms are of adequate size.\nHowever, there is insufficient space and tables for the participants to conduct exercises in workbooks or work in teams.\n• The National Public Administration Institute of Paraguay (INAPP) has a training facility that meets international best training practices. However, the rooms are small and can only accommodate around ten (10) to 20 participants. They also have a computer lab that can accommodate 18 participants. \n\nQuantitative data was collected and analyzed for trends, similarities and differences in stakeholder’s responses. Below are the key quantitative data findings, organized for ease of review:\n\n1.4.1 PUBLIC EXPENDITURE AND FINANCIAL ACCOUNTABILITY\n\n• Major weaknesses in planning and budgeting concentrate mainly in the key domains selected by the DGP for the Budget Competency Survey.\n• The outcomes of the TNA are consistent with the findings highlighted in the Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) assessment in that gaps in skills and competencies are high in the\ndomains considered as primal, such as financial planning, budget accounting and reporting, and leading practices in planning and budgeting.\n• MH has devised a medium-term reform strategy, the Public Financial Management Reform Action Plan (PFM RAP) 2012-2015, to improve planning and budgeting and sustain capacity development, in response to the latest PEFA assessment.\n\n1.4.2 BUDGET COMPETENCY SURVEY\n\n• 318 employees completed the survey of a population of approximately 419. This gives a confidence level of 99% with a margin of error of four (4). This means that the MH and LMs can be 99% confident that the results are within a 4% margin of error of what the MH and LM staff actually believe concerning their budget competencies and their importance. \n• The survey revealed that competencies across Domain #3: Financial Planning and Budgeting were the weakest areas across MH and the LMs in terms of importance and effectiveness. Competencies relating to understanding of the role of taxation and non-tax revenues in the financing of budgets were the lowest overall and below international leading practice.\n• Competencies across Domain #1: Legal and Institutional Arrangements for Budget Preparation were the strongest across MH and LMs in terms of importance and effectiveness. Respondents\ndemonstrated that they have an average to above average understanding of the budget process and its role in PFM.\n\n1.4.3 INSTITUTION CAPACITY SURVEY\n• 103 employees completed the survey of a population of approximately 131. This gives a confidence level of 99% with a margin of error of six (6). This means that the MH and LMs can be 99% confident that the results are within a 6% margin of error of what the MH staff actually believe about their work and workplace.\n• The lowest rated section of the Institution Capacity Survey is Management and Senior Management (24.23% gap) followed by Communications (22.53% gap). The three lowest rated questions are: fairly compensated (38.00% gap), MH values my work and contributions (31.62% gap) and team has regular meetings (28.33% gap).\n• MH management is not fully aware of their training and development role and responsibilities.\n\n1.4.4 HUMAN RESOURCES PRACTICES ASSESSMENT\n• MHs three (3) weakest human resources areas listed in priority order are: \n          1. Compensation          2. Appraisal, Development, and Career Planning\n           3. Training and Orientation.• This is consistent with the findings in the Institution Capacity Survey.\n• The MH training and development function is understaffed in accordance to international best practices.\n\n1.4.5 TRAINING PROVIDER EVALUATIONS\n• The MH and LM internal training providers (MH, MAG, MEC, MOPC AND MSPyBS) lack expertise in Instructional Systems Design (ISD) and application of the ADDIE Model (Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation and Evaluation) for needs assessment as well as course design, development, delivery and evaluation.\n• None of the MH and LM’s internal training providers meet international training standards. Both the qualitative and quantitative data surfaced very similar key findings validating the Training Needs\nAssessment findings documented in this report.",
      "Key Recommendations": "This section contains the recommendations to improve individual and organizational performance based\non the qualitative and quantitative data collected from the Training Needs Assessment as well as the\nconsiderations provided in the previous section:\n• Recommendation 1: MH should prioritize improving the budgeting legal framework, enacting\nparticipatory budgeting processes, promote mechanisms and tools that help to ground assumptions in\nrealistic operating plans, and provide training to all employees at all levels in the identified budgeting\ncompetencies and processes (Domain #3: Financial Planning and Budgeting).\n• Recommendation 2: MH should capture and clarify the roles, responsibilities and accountabilities\ninvolved in the budget preparation process along with providing clear job descriptions, and\ncomprehensive policies and procedures to guide the day-to-day tasks and expectations in budget\npreparation.\n• Recommendation 3: Learning Development Plans should be established as they are critical to the\nsustainability and effectiveness of MH and LM departments, divisions and units. Equal effort should\nbe given to providing coaching, mentoring and on-the-job training for all MH and LM staff to capitalize\non the reality that between 80% and 90% of all learning occurs outside of the classroom.\n• Recommendation 4: Consideration should be given to expanding existing MH’s Training Committee\nmandate (established in the 2010 Training Act) to include internal training so that it may serve as a\nTraining Advisory Board. The expanded Training Committee would be responsible for annually\ndetermining the courses that would be designed, developed, delivered and evaluated internally in\naccordance to a more robust Training Needs Assessment.\n• Recommendation 5: Courses proposed as part of this program should be sequenced by the Training\nAdvisory Board according to priorities and levels of skills proficiency and competency. All budget\npreparation courses should be performance-based and provide both theory and practice so that\nknowledge and skills, or competencies, are built and sustained.\n• Recommendation 6: The Training Advisory Board should evaluate the merits of appointing MH’s\nHead of Human Resources Department of Well Being and Training to be the MH Training Lead to\nsupport the implementation of the Sustainable Learning Transformation. This will foster capacity\nbuilding and long-term sustainability.\n• Recommendation 7: Training Departments within each Line Ministry should build and implement a\ncomprehensive Training of Trainer’s Program and require all employees engaged in staff training to\ntake and successfully pass the program. Successful completion would entail designing, developing\nand delivering programs in accordance to international best training standards.\n• Recommendation 8: Training Departments within the MH and the Line Ministries should be\nstrengthened so they can be less reliant on externally provided training. Building expertise in\nInstructional Systems Design and the application of the ADDIE Model to determine, design, develop,\ndeliver and evaluate training within these units is strongly recommended.\n• Recommendation 9: Any Training of Trainers Program should begin within MH and then be rolled-\nout to line ministries following similar training governance and instructor selection arrangements.\n• Recommendation 10: Strong consideration should be given to purchasing additional training related\nfurniture and equipment for the MH to provide a training room that meets international best training\npractices.\n• Recommendation 11: Existing budget instructors should be encouraged to apply for the Training of\nTrainers Program so that they can grouped according to their work, and academic specialization\nalong with the planning and budgeting competencies and fourteen technical courses proposed in this\nreport. This will allow them to design, develop and deliver performance-based courses that provide\ndocumented learning and high on-the-job retention.\n• Recommendation 12: MH needs to strengthen and appropriately staff several human resources\nfunctions to support the implementation of performance-based budget training listed in priority order:\no Training and Orientation\no Appraisal, Development and Career Planning\no Strategy, Planning, Policies and Communication\no Succession Planning.\n• Recommendation 13: A Standard Operations Procedure Manual for Training should be written that\nreflects a culture of accountability and transparency, characteristics that are integral to sustainability.\nThis manual should be a living document that is frequently referenced, well-communicated, and\nrevised.\n• Recommendation 14: The MH should provide training to all managers to promote a standardized\nlevel of managerial support. In addition, all managers should be trained to provide direct, clear and\ntimely communication with all staff.",

      "Key Findings": "2014 was a momentous year for Feed the Future. In addition to helping millions of smallholder farmers improve their yields and incomes and\nhelping families—particularly mothers and young children—improve nutrition, new data show that our efforts are contributing to downward trends in poverty and malnutrition, Feed the Future’s two top goals. These results suggest that Feed the Future can meet its ambitious goal of reducing poverty and stunting by an average of 20 percent across the areas where the initiative works. While additional impact data are still being collected to measure changes in incomes and poverty, preliminary data indicate that Feed the Future programs, along with complementary U.S. Government and other donor activities, are building a strong foundation for continued economic growth and\nresilient communities.

      "Key Findings": "Below are illustrative indicators for each of the six health systems\nfunctions noted in the case study:\n\nHuman Resources for Health\n• Total number of health care workers relative to population and dis aggregated by cadre, sex, age, and distribution (geographic, facility, and sector)\n• Production of health care workers consistent with existing and future human resources needed to deliver priority health services, especially child and maternal health, family planning, and HIV and AIDS services\n• Percentage of national and/or health budget allocated to human resources development and management annually.\n\nHealth Finance\n• Total private and public spending on health care, with dis-aggregation of pure public spending on health as a share of total health expenditures.\n• Out-of-pocket health spending in the lowest two income quintiles.\n• Coverage for people in the bottom two income quintilesunder social health insurance schemes.\n\nHealth Governance\n• Health policy index score15\n• Number of community-based organizations that formally participate in government decision-making at the national, state, and local level\n• Number of community-based organizations receiving U.S. Government assistance engaged in health advocacy\n\nHealth Information\n• Evidence-based decisions made and actions taken using data sources supported by USAID assistance. \n• Availability of service readiness data from a health facility assessment survey (based on international standards) implemented within the previous 3 years.\n• Existence of a functioning health information system governance mechanism (multi-stakeholder national committee/regulatory body).\n\nMedical Products,Vaccines, and Technologies• Median availability of selected (essential) generic medicines (percentage) in public facilities.\n• Regulatory decisions made and actions taken based on local  pharmacovigilance data in the last 2 years.\n• Existence of routine medicines quality monitoring system for the public and private sectors \n\nService Delivery• Mean level of compliance with applicable clinical guidelines for essential services for a sample of patients\n• Mean mortality rate at one week for a sample of children under 5 years who were treated for uncomplicated pneumonia\n• Proportion of public and private facilities with copies of all applicable national clinical guideline\n• Existence of cost-effective essential services packages",
      "Key Recommendations": "Just as there is no single ideal health system, there is no single approach to HSS. Countries operate in different political, social, economic, cultural, demographic, and epidemiological contexts, from fragile states with weak economies to those with democratic governance and emerging economic growth. Broad political economy issues often drive health systems organization, priorities, and performance. That said, some commonly used process steps to design an HSS program, either stand-alone or integrated into a health service delivery project, are necessary to initiate country-based HSS strategic plans and activities. The critical first step is to conduct a health systems assessment. A health systems assessment includes a detailed examination of the health system environment as a foundation, along with an analysis of the six health systems functions, and includes a description of the private health sector. USAID’s The Health Systems Assessment Approach – A How-To Manual (2.0) is a key field resource. The health systems assessment typically is conducted with a team of internal USAID andexternal partners’ experts selected by the mission. \n\nA mission may use this Vision and its health systems assessment together to take the next steps to create comprehensive HSS programs. The Vision and health systems assessment may be used to: inform new project designs and re-designs in Project Approval Documents; make\ndecisions on priorities for limited financial resources; guide project work plans and activities and mid-term reviews; structure and complete Health Implementation Plans, HSS action plans, and other USAID reporting; create monitoring and evaluation plans, including the selection of key indicators; design and conduct baseline, mid-term, and\nend-line project evaluations; share with national governments to influence and advocate for them to adopt HSS strategies and policies; and engage in global dialogue with multilateral and bilateral partners, non-governmental organizations, and private sector to stress the need for strategic investments in HSS.\n\nEvidence on the extent to which interventions to strengthen and enhance health systems performance contribute to improvements in health status has been scarce, scattered and not widely disseminated. USAID and other partners have been challenged by a lack of a robust evidence base for investing scarce health funds in HSS interventions in\nan environment of competing investment options.\n\nTo enhance the basis for decision-making, GH commissioned a rapid review of systemic reviews to summarize and document the effects of HSS interventions on proxy measures for health status. The preliminary results of this rapid review identified thirteen HSS interventions that have demonstrated a positive effect on the following proxy health outcome measures: improved service provision/quality; increased financial protection; increased service utilization; uptake of healthy behaviors; and reduced morbidity and mortality.",

      "Key Findings": "Over the last year, the Global Development Lab has worked closely with our Agency partners to deliver the kind of game changing results that we have been so proud of throughout USAID’s 50 year history. In 2014, 47 USAID Missions and Bureaus used the Lab’s tools, approaches, and mechanisms to drive results, investing $54 million. In addition, 18 Missions and Bureaus actively collaborated with the Lab on the Agency’s priority STIP efforts, including integrating e-payments into Agency operations, scaling climate resilient maize, and supporting biodiversity conservation in the Brazilian Amazon. These partnerships will deepen in the coming year. The Lab also seeks to lead the development community on evidence-based decision making. In this first year, the Lab’s Office of Evaluation and Impact Assessment has ensured monitoring, evaluation, and learning practices reflect the Lab’s high expectations for the production and use of quality evidence for decision-making. \n\nThe Lab has set evidence standards in consultation with experts from academia, industry, and other actors in the development community to determine which innovations are ‘best bets’ for continued investment. Finally, the Lab is leading a collaboration with external partners to develop, and drive adoption of, innovative tools and methodologies in monitoring, evaluation, and learning that enable the Agency to rapidly and responsibly iterate and improve programming, and make the use of data and evidence in decision-making more feasible. As the Lab does its work to produce breakthrough development innovations, we look to work with all our partners to transform the U.S. development enterprise — all to reach the goal of accelerating an end to extreme poverty.",

As market-based solutions to development challenges gain prominence, the Agency and its partners are sharing best practices, and contributing to a growing field of knowledge of public-private partnerships that advance market-based solutions to\ndevelopment challenges. Additionally, partnering is becoming embedded across USAID, changing the Agency internally. USAID is investing in training to build the capacity of Agency staff around the world to work with the private sector, recruiting more people with  private sector experience and skills, and implementing more robust approaches to manage ongoing relationships with private sector partners.",
      "Key Recommendations": "It is a key Agency priority to make partnering more efficient and effective—reducing the transaction costs of building and maintaining public-private partnerships and accelerating their ability to realize progress. Together, all of those working at the intersection of business and global development must do a better job of measuring and understanding the impact of partnerships, replicating successes, and acknowledging and learning from failures and mistakes. The Agency will continue to pursue partnerships with local and global corporations,\nand boost investments in business-related reforms in partner countries around the world. This approach will accelerate the ability of the  Agency and its partners to deliver results, and to do so with greater efficiency and long-term sustainability.",

      "Key Findings": "The recommended process for planning and implementing an effective MWM system may be categorized into the six phases illustrated in Figure 1 which presents both the anticipated functions and activities that a municipality should undertake in developing its MWM plans. \n\n• The Planning Preparation Phase: This is the initial planning function that should be that is aimed at defining and mobilizing the resources necessary for the municipality’s comprehensive planning effort.\n\n• The Existing Conditions Status Phase: This is the planning function intended to define current baseline conditions by assessing a municipality’s existing MWM system and all of the factors that influence its function and deficiencies.\n\n• The Options Assessment Phase: Once a municipality’s existing MWM system has been accurately and thoroughly defined, viable alternatives (technical, institutional, financial, etc.) to overcoming existing system deficiencies and meeting requirements of the Law “Waste Management Code” must be evaluated to determine which of the options available for the various system elements are in the best interest of the\nmunicipality. This option’s assessment phase provides the basis for establishing the WM action plan that will be the foundation of the municipality’s implementation strategy for planned improvements.\n\n• The Plan Adoption Phase ‐ Once existing MWM conditions in the municipality have been defined and viable options to overcome existing deficiencies have been identified, assessed, and selected, the MWM Plan and its implementation strategy should be formally  adopted by municipal elected officials and approved by national\nregulatory officials responsible for assuring that the MWM Plan and its\nrecommendations comply with the requirements of the “Waste Management Code”.\n\n• The Implementation Phase: After the formal adoption of the municipality’s MWM plan, the implementation of the plan’s target outcomes can occur which may include the development of policy, financial/economic, institutional, and technical instruments that are to improve the MWM system as well as implementing the physical processes and facilities necessary to achieve result.\n\n• The Monitoring & Review Phase: Once all or some of the target results of the plan have been implemented, the function of the resulting MWM system (or its individual components) must be closely monitored to assure that the plan results are sustainable and remain effective over time. In addition, the municipality should also recognize that a  successful planning process is dynamic and ongoing and requires\nperiodic review to update the plan in accordance with evolving conditions and what has been accomplished since the adoption of the initial MWM plan. (The Law “Waste Management Code” stipulates that the MWM plans should be developed for a 5 year planning term. This will establish the need to review the accomplishments of the municipality after five years and update the Plan to continue progress in accomplishing the municipality’s MWM objectives as well as the long term objectives of the “Waste Management Code”.)",

      "Document Title": "From Transparency to  Accountability? Assessing How International Multi-stakeholder Initiatives are Contributing to  Public Governance",
      "Key Findings": "The links in the chain that connect information disclosure to public accountability are still uncertain. \n\nThis report finds that in many countries, governance-oriented MSIs have indeed managed to get traction with their promotion of public information disclosure reforms—in other words, more information is often available to the public, in part thanks to these initiatives. But there is little evidence as yet that these transparency outputs lead to accountability outcomes – at least so far. It turns out that the theories of change that connect transparency to accountability in governance MSIs  involve many more links in the chain than were originally envisioned.\n\nThe available research documents both the progress and limits of MSI-driven information disclosure, but more studies are needed to explain whether and how this progress drives tangible improvements in accountability. Several bottlenecks seem to be especially relevant:\n\nIn practice, government commitment to these MSIs is often weak or inconsistent. Governmental sign-on to MSIs may or may not indicate that commitment to open governance is shared across the state apparatus. Indeed, insider governmental advocates of openness often lack leverage over the rest of their governments – which is precisely why they might need (inter)national coalitions to give them a boost (as spelled out in OGP’s strategic plan, for example). Yet the closing of civic space in some MSI countries raises questions about the “net accountability effect” of their affiliation. In those difficult contexts, when does implicit MSI ‘certification’ bolster beleaguered reformists and keep doors open a crack, and when does it serve more to provide cover for fundamentally undemocratic regimes (i.e. openwashing)?\nGovernmental accountability institutions may be too weak or captured to act based on relevant information disclosures. After all, nation-states are composed of many moving parts, and the branches in charge of dealing with information disclosure often have little to do with those responsible for the rule of law. Consider the recent 2015 Open Budget Index: the Mexican government was given high marks for its now well-established information disclosure institutions, yet at the same time, even when high-level conflicts of interest (such as transactions between the president’s family and government contractors) are revealed to the public, the state’s accountability institutions turn out to have their own conflicts of interest and decline to act.\nIt’s hard to translate open data into actionable information. While more open data holds great promise, “infomediaries” (civic information processors) are still learning how to transform data that is often technical, aggregate, and/or abstract into information that is actionable for allies who have the civic muscle necessary to influence the powers that be.\nMSIs are bargaining processes where CSO technical sophistication is key, but expertise is no substitute for political clout. CSOs engaged with MSIs tend to be specialized, technical organizations rather than broad-based organizations with reach outside professional classes in the national capital. In some countries, moreover, CSOs engaged with MSIs are seen as lacking autonomy from their governments. These issues limit CSO participants’ political clout and their claim to represent civil society more broadly. For MSIs to sustain reform momentum, they need to “broaden their base” within national civil societies.",
      "Key Recommendations": "So how do we open up these bottlenecks? One key place to look for the coalitions and strategies necessary to do so is at the national level. Some MSIs seek to build national-level multi-sectoral coalitions that can exercise the civic muscle needed to really embed new norms and standards into national institutions. This process of forming national multi-stakeholder groups has gone the furthest in EITI and OGP, though only a minority function well. For example, in EITI, while some countries that are not certified have functioning MSGs, other countries that are certified have weak or unrepresentative MSGs.  In OGP, according to civil society liaison coordinator Paul Maassen, “How solid the coordination within civil society is at country level is more difficult to understand. There seems to be some sort of coordination in at least 2/3 of participating countries, with active coalitions in about 15-25% of the countries.” Another promising approach to broadening and deepening the constituencies for MSIs involves the involvement of subnational governments, as EITI is doing in Peru and the Philippines.",

The study revealed definitive trends in their approaches and methodologies. Most of the interviewed organizations (1) establish farmer field schools and demonstration plots, (2) build capacity of lead farmers and rely on them to foster continued knowledge exchanges, and (3) provide farmers with credit mechanisms and increase their access to markets, particularly through the use of Information Communication Technologies (ICTs). Another strong trend suggests that development organizations strive to ensure program sustainability by engaging the private-for-profit sector and building local capacities. Finally, our findings suggest that organizations attempt to mainstream gender issues, include participatory \nplanning in project design, and pursue participatory monitoring and evaluation strategies throughout the project cycle, though implementing participatory approaches can be a challenge. During the interviews the organizations shared some particularly successful approaches and strategies that have helped them in pursuing their objectives, but also discussed implementation challenges.",

      "Document Title": "West Africa Private Health Sector: Six Macro-Level Assessments",
      "Key Findings": "While the region is extremely diverse, the six countries share a strong pronatalist stance and account for some of the highest birth rates in the\nworld. Regional themes that emerged from the assessments and that shape the private health sector include the following:\n\n• Health expenditures\nOut-of-pocket spending represents more than 75 percent of private\nexpenditures in all six countries. Scope of the private sector. Data show the large extent of the private health sector in West Africa. In Cameroon and Côte d’Ivoire, for example, private facilities represent 44 and 52% of all health facilities, respectively. The informal sector is thriving in all six countries, but, beyond anecdotal information, the data are limited. In addition, the six focus countries are at the bottom of the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business Report (2014).\n\n• Enabling environment for private health sector.\nThe six countries demonstrate weak enforcement of laws regarding noncompliant private health facilities; lack of incentives to develop private health facilities in rural areas; outdated, inadequate, and lax enforcement of inspection standards; and poor private sector reporting, including disease surveillance. Where fora (platform in French) for a public-private dialogue interaction exist, they do not meet regularly and may not include the for-profit health sector. The two exceptions are Burkina Faso and Côte d’Ivoire. HIV and family planning product and service provision. The private sector varies as a major source of family planning methods, responding to the needs of just 5.4 % of Nigerians and to more than 50 % of residents of Togo, Côte d’Ivoire, and Cameroon. Free or subsidized provision of many family planning and HIV products limits the private sector’s incentive to offer such\nproducts. Private provision of HIV and AIDS services varies by country, by type of service, and by private provider category, but, in general, the\nfor-profit sector is marginally involved. However, the nonprofit sector is much more involved in HIV and AIDS treatment, delivering 45% of all ART treatment in Togo and maintaining 65 treatment sites in Côte d’Ivoire. Private providers in all six countries expressed an interest in expanding the provision o family planning and HIV services, provided that a clear regulatory environment legally allows them to charge a fair price for service delivery.\n\n• Corporate social responsibility. \nCorporate social responsibility (CSR) is not well developed in the region. It is largely limited to oil and mining companies as well as to large-scale agricultural and brewery conglomerates that focus more on HIV than on family planning. Within each of the six countries, CSR organizations and business coalitions can help USAID navigate the CSR landscape and develop connections with companies interested in forging health partnerships.\n\n• Public-private partnerships. The region accountsfor a low number of public-private partnerships (PPPs) as compared with other regions such as East Africa. Among the six countries, most PPPs focus on service contracts with NGOs tied to the community-based distribution of HIV and family planning products and services.",
      "Key Recommendations": "The six West African countries represent considerable diversity in terms of economic and social development, unmet family planning and reproductive health need, level of HIV delivery in the private sector, and market maturity. Yet, the countries share characteristics unique to the region, particularly with respect to reproductive behavior, private sector growth, and health sector reforms. Drawing on interviews with key stakeholders as well as on Internet research, the assessment team developed regional and country-specific recommendations, as presented below.\n\nRegional Recommendations\n• Improve the public-private landscape across the region through ministry of health collaboration with WAHO as catalyst, convener, and connector. Ministries of health in each country are important drivers of public-private collaboration and set the tone for partnerships. In collaboration with WAHO, they could develop a regional private sector alliance to advocate for the development of standards across West Africa for private sector engagement, reporting, and disease surveillance. Each country, in turn, could develop its national private health sector strategy to increase the private sector’s role in health care delivery. \n\n• Develop total market approaches to family planning by relying on contraceptive security committees.  Currently, WAHO is involved in a total market approach for contraceptive procurement, yet government stakeholders interviewed for the assessment demonstrated little understanding of or voiced no interest in pursuing a total market approach. USAID/West Africa projects could work with WAHO and the contraceptive security committees in the six countries to conduct national market segmentation exercises and ensure involvement of the for-profit health sector with each country’s contraceptive security committee. \n\n• Increase access to family planning services through collaboration with affiliates in focus countries. Collaboration with private provider networks that include social franchises and clinic outreach programs, such as Marie Stopes International, International Planned Parenthood Association, and Population Services International, offer the most direct way to increase access to family planning methods in rural and urban areas. Building on existing programs can help leverage scarce family planning resources while attaining economies of scale. \n\n• Increase corporate social responsibility opportunities within countries and across the region. The CSR landscape has undergone significant change, and multinationals are more selective and less willing to engage in CSR activities unrelated to their core business. In each country, it is important to reach companies through CSR associations and business councils in order to preselect companies interested in HIV- and family planning-focused partnerships. \n\n• Develop public-private partnerships with mining companies in West Africa. While mining companies in the region are smaller than those in other parts of Africa, they offer the best opportunity for health-related PPPs among multinationals in the region. These companies could integrate family planning services into existing HIV-related activities at their workplaces.\n\n• Increase learning within the region. Stakeholders interviewed in each country expressed interest in learning more about both unauthorized\nhealth facilities and illegal drug sellers. Research documenting the scale and scope of the informal sector’s involvement in service provision and\ndelivery of health products would be a first step in determining how to improve the sector’s role in the provision of high quality family planning and HIV services. The development of a regional private sector alliance requires a regional mechanism for the sharing of information and experience through an online community of practice. Examination and documentation of successful public-private initiatives can also help move West African countries toward stronger private sector  engagement in health. West African countries are increasing their attention on PPP infrastructure, with some countries passing laws to encourage companies’ investment. Nonetheless, the countries need assistance in moving from partnerships focused on infrastructure\nto those focused on health.",

      "Document Title": "Rwanda Health Private Sector Engagement Assessment",
      "Key Findings": "The findings of the case study can be divided into these categories:\n\n•Leadership & Advocacy\nThere is strong leadership and political will at senior levels, which is a critical success factor for PSE. The level of understanding/support for PSE varies within the GOR but there is a lack of systems and knowledge about how to engage the private sector, especially to develop PPPs. On top of this, effective coordination and clarity of roles and responsibilities between key stakeholders, such as the MOH, Rwanda Development Board (RDB), and RBC, is lacking and thus, limiting effective PSE. There is a lack of adequate capacity within the MOH, RDB, and RBC for effective PSE and PPP development and only limited dialogue and no formal platforms and systems for public and private engagement.\n\n• Policy and Planning\nThe overall tax and investment environment in Rwanda is favorable for private sector development (please see Annex B of the full assessment report for more discussion).  A new PPP legal framework has been approved (not disseminated) and the MOH, RBC, and RDB all have units or positions designed to engage the private health sector. Health-specific incentives in the tax and investment code are lacking, the implementation of PSE policies and plans is slow and PPP mechanisms and PSE/PPP planning process are not finalized. There are inadequate resources for effective PSE and PPP development and national- and district-level managers lack adequate skills and business know-how to implement PSE and PPPs.\n\nThe private sector and other key stakeholders are not adequately engaged in policy development and planning and there is limited communication and confidence between the public and private sectors. Current GOR tariff structure and complex regulations (e.g. procurement, licensing, and customs) can impede PSE. The new electronic single window system may facilitate trade by speeding up and simplifying information flows while there are opportunities to increase revenue collections on the importation and registration of new pharmaceutical products. Most private sector associations have limited organizational capacity while most hospitals lack autonomy, which creates  accountability, management, and efficiency issues.\n\n• Investment and Access to Finance \nThere is currently some financing for the private health sector. Loan terms (collateral requirements, interest rates, borrower contributions) and lack of start-up capital restrict borrowing. There is low domestic and foreign investment in the health sector and is compounded by the fact that the RDB has limited knowledge of the health sector and  institutional capacity to increase investment in this sector. Limited business skills in the health sector prevent increased access to finance and investment.\n\n• Corporate Social Responsibility\nThere are some examples of CSR (including PPPs) for the health sector in Rwanda, including GlaxoSmithKline’s support for One Family Health and Bralirwa’s funding for the local manufacturing of mosquito nets and workplace programming. Currently, most CSR funding is in the agricultural and information, communication, and technology (ICT) sectors by multinational companies mainly due to GOR-, DP-led investment promotion activities. There is low domestic and foreign investment in the health sector.\n\n• Health Subsector\nService Delivery: The private health sector is interested in expanding and partnering with the public sector and some public facilities are actively exploring PPPs. The private service delivery sector is small and fragmented but there is an opportunity to develop a sustainable private health post model and significant interest to increase PPPs and other income-generation strategies within facilities. There is no clear process and legal framework, and limited capacit to develop and implement PPPs.  “Business culture” and business skills are limited at the facility level. There is an interest and opportunity to strengthen and promote\nspecialized services and tertiary care in the private sector\n\nHealth Financing: Rwanda has made substantial progress towards universal coverage, overcoming financial barriers and improving equity. The private service delivery sector is small and fragmented and the integration of CBHI under the RSSB poses an opportunity for improved operational, financial, and management efficiencies. A high dependency on donor funding, which is declining, and the low purchasing power of the population is creating stress. The current GOR tariff is low, deterring private sector investment. A costing exercise has been completed to revise the GOR tariff structure, which is now awaiting approval. CBHI claim processing and payment inefficiencies and delays negatively impact private HPs. Opportunities exist to better integrate private  insurance into the health financing system. Most community health worker (CHW) cooperatives operate income-generation activities  (although low-profit), and income generation at the DH level is limited. There is interest in expanding income generation and improving efficiencies, but DH managers lack the skills and mindset.\n\nHRH\nThe lack of skilled health care workers is a constraint to PSE, to the development of specialized private health services, and to the privatization of medical equipment maintenance. The GOR is aware of the HRH problem and has a long-term vision and plan in place for  developing a skilled workforce. Retention is a major issue, particularly in rural areas.\n\nMedical Products\nThere is an active private pharmaceutical sector and a relatively\nactive private pharmacy sector. There are plans to strengthen  biomedical engineering skills, and the GOR is creating a Center of Excellence for biomedical engineering that will serve as an East African regional resource. There is insufficient funding and planning for medical equipment maintenance and management, and a culture of  replacement rather than repair due to donor dependency. There is a lack of skilled biomedical engineers and technicians. There are complex procurement and customs requirements for medical equipment and spare parts. There is almost no local medical product/equipment manufacturing.\n\nHIS\nThe GOR has made significant strides in e-health but there are\nmore opportunities to increase efficiencies through increased use of technology and PSE. There is increased use of DHIS2 with a high reporting rate and limited existing initiatives of private sector engagement in health information and mobile technology (e.g. RapidSMS). There are weak basic computer and IT skills at various levels. There is inefficient institutional capacity and systems, and high cost of basic IT and help desk operation. The high cost of Internet, including high set-up and operational costs for infrastructure, unstable electricity, and lack of resources, makes operations quite costly.\n\nHPP\nOutreach and demand-creation activities can improve the viability of\nsmall-scale private providers. PPPs related to HPP are working well, but there is significant room to improve and expand. There is an increased number of registered CHWs with high commitment to HPP work. There has been limited corporate engagement related HPP/CSR. New training programs are being developed for community health technicians on noncommunicable diseases in collaboration with the Workforce Development Authority. There are inadequate resources and access to HPP trainings.\n\nLKMThere are a number of existing PPPs geared towards training\nfacilitation, education, and knowledge transfer but there is limited knowledge within the GOR about health PPPs/PSE, no central database on the private sector, and no evidence base. There is also low clinical and operational research capacity (public and private), and inadequate PS involvement.",

      "Key Findings": "Kenya needs to create more than 3.9 million new jobs for young people by 2020. According to recent estimates, over 1.5 million people are unemployed in Kenya, and over a third of them are young people between the ages of 15 and 24. In addition, Kenya’s workforce is projected to grow by 3.4 million people between 2014 and 2020, due primarily to new young adults entering the job market. Scaleups are some of the largest job creators in Kenya and can help to reduce youth unemployment. A 2013 World Bank survey found that only 5 percent of Kenyan companies were scaleups, but these companies created 72 percent of all new jobs generated during the previous three years. Furthermore, these scaleups need access to markets, talent, and funding in order to succeed. According to a survey of more than 1,000 entrepreneurial leaders from around the world, these three factors are the most important contributors to a firm’s growth and success. Contrary to the prevailing wisdom among many policymakers, respondents did not mention other factors such as regulatory frameworks or low taxes.\n",

      "Document ID": "1504-4Chil-UGA",
      "Document Title": "USAID/Uganda OVC Portfolio Review ",
      "Key Findings": "As agreed upon with USAID/Uganda, the team prioritized review of specific topics related to OVC programming in Uganda including systems strengthening, child protection, targeting and enrollment,\ngraduation and coordination with care and treatment partners. A rapid analysis of the existing USAID OVC Strategy for Uganda was also included as part of the portfolio review. These findings are informed\nby the desk review, key informant interviews and an understanding of the current context, both nationally and globally, regarding OVC programming priorities. In general, the team found the existing strategy to be comprehensive, reflect global and national priorities related to OVC and was evidence based with minimal need to change or adapt the existing strategy or approach.\n\n• Social Service Systems and Child Protection Capacity\nStrengthening the social service system requires understanding and addressing (1) the unique and mandated role of government to oversee, coordinate and manage the system to ensure that interventions are sustainable; (2) the active and planned engagement of civil society to support government, especially in the provision of social services; and (3) the need to develop or strengthen a range of interventions aimed at coordinating and strengthening the different components that make up the system. Given that the systems  strengthening approach is relatively new within the OVC sector, it was not surprising that there was significant variance in OVC implementing partners’ understanding of the approach and the role of government, as well as what is meant by terms such as ‘child protection.’ \n\nThese differences in understanding were particularly acute among non-OVC focused implementing partners that have OVC among their target populations, but not as their primary mandate. The USAID Mission in Uganda is in a unique position to support the transition to a more standardized approach and understanding by all OVC implementing partners of both the systems strengthening approach and the importance of child protection. If USAID continues to integrate OVC funds into larger non-OVC projects, then it may be worthwhile for project management of these projects to participate in a one-day management level orientation to social services strengthening and child protection based on the Makerere University Child Protection Training outlined in this report. This workshop would help implementing partners to adopt standardized terminology and a shared understanding of key concepts, building the foundation for improved coordination across the OVC response, and strengthening linkages\nwith the government social welfare system.\n\n• Targeting and Enrollment\nTargeting and enrollment are the processes used to identify and enroll households and children that will be served by a specific project or intervention. The USAID Mission has identified the most HIV affected areas of Uganda as geographic targets for their OVC programming, but each implementing partner uses different approaches and tools to identify beneficiaries. For example, one approach was a community mapping by district social welfare officers under the SUNRISE-OVC project, where data and targeting information was shared with other USAID projects such as the Sustainable Comprehensive Responses for Vulnerable Children and their families project (SCORE) and with smaller civil society organization initiatives in the districts. In contrast, district and sub-county government officials typically used the Child Status Index (CSI) and Child Protection Registration Forms while other OVC projects used the Vulnerability Index. Several projects developed their own tools and approaches. USAID-funded partners might be required to utilize government-endorsed targeting and enrollment tools in order to the consistency of approach across projects and to foster recognition of the government’s role within the system. Those tools might also benefit from some review and modification. \n• Graduation\nGraduation is typically understood as the process of moving a  household, family or child from receiving services (i.e., they are found to be in a place wherein they do not require services). Graduation is also utilized when discussing household economic strengthening and refers to a household moving from one type of economic vulnerability to a less vulnerable level. From key informant interviews with implementing partners, it appears that not all of them have an explicit graduation strategy. Those that do use a range of criteria to graduate beneficiaries including the age of the child, the level of schooling, and (in projects with a strong household economic strengthening component) analysis of household economic vulnerability using a combination of the Vulnerability Index (VI) and CSI or a project-specific assessment tool. USAID, in partnership with the Ministry of Gender, Labour and Social Development (MGLSD), may want to consider convening a technical working group on graduation. The working group would be tasked with providing definitions of graduation in different contexts, how to measure graduation and what level of resiliency and/or changes in vulnerability can be anticipated over specific time periods ranging from, say, one to five years. \n• Case Management\nThe Portfolio Review found that there is no unified approach to case management and that implementing partners use a range of case management and referral mechanisms. There are two main findings related to case management systems: 1) Lack of a unified approach to case management and 2) lack of a common monitoring and evaluation (M & E) system to support case management. SUNRISE-OVC appears to have placed significant emphasis on developing case management, supporting district and sub-county government officials to use the CSI to complete home visit forms and to track consultations in a case management book. In spite of these achievements, there are inconsistencies within that project in the use of the tools and shortcomings in the existing approach. For example, there is no unique identifier for beneficiaries to assign cases by child or household, rather than by incident. There is also limited reach to deliver services at the community level and a lack of a clear follow-up process to ensure the case is resolved.This review found across the portfolio that there is an absence of unique identifiers, standard case files and/or procedures to store case files, as well as limited movement to transition to electronic case files, which would allow for improved trend analysis and linkages across the system. The National OVC MIS system facilitates tracking children reached, but is not designed as a case management tool, although it has the potential to serve as an important component of a strengthened case management system.\n•  Referral mechanisms\nCase management and referral mechanisms are closely linked. A strong case management system must include clear and coordinated referral procedures to ensure that any given case plan (and the services to be delivered) is followed in a coordinated, timely and child sensitive manner. This review found that each project had some kind of referral system in place that linked health facilities, CSOs and/or government service providers, but that there was significant variation in the specific strategy and effectiveness of these systems. Referral mechanisms reviewed ranged from formal to informal. Some provided the client with a standard referral form, while others relied on word of mouth or direct accompaniment of the client to the next point of service (which can be particularly important for victims of child protection violations such as defilement or abuse). According to key informant interviews, actors from several projects stated that completion of the referral by the client depended on several factors including perceived value of the service by the client, geographic location and distance/transport options to reach the service, availability of the service and whether the client met the selection criteria. Given the gaps and limitations identified in the current system, there’s a need to review and leverage lessons learned from the portfolio and work might be launched to develop standard operating procedures for case management and the associated referral mechanisms. \n\nHIV/AIDS and OVC \nA growing evidence base demonstrates the linkages between HIV and child protection related adversities. For example, there appears to be an association between HIV infection and early sexual debut and/or sexual violence. There is also the increased likelihood of children in households affected by HIV of contracting the disease. Children affected by HIV in turn face protective challenges such as stigma or lack of family or suitable alternative care. The Portfolio Review paid particularly attention to the linkages between HIV and OVC vulnerability, specifically, the identification of pediatric cases, disclosure and treatment adherence, sexual violence and HIV and coordination between community-based OVC services and facility-based care and treatment partners.\n\n• Case identification. \nCare and treatment partners interviewed believed they are exhausting\nefforts to identify HIV+ children that have not been tested or are not receiving appropriate care and treatment. They are conducting near universal testing in pediatric wards, increasing provider initiated testing and follow up (PITC), following up on HIV Exposed Infants (HEI) at\nreproductive health clinics (whose mothers gave birth at home) and increasing HIV testing during antenatal visits. Most are finding low prevalence of HIV among children and question UNAIDS estimates. In contrast, OVC partners know of HIV+ children in their communities who\nnever reach care and treatment centers, likely due to fear of being stigmatized within their communities. Overall, new cases of children has made a noted decrease in the past several years most likely due to an increase in PMTCT services and roll out of ART.\n\n• Disclosure and adherence. \nIn key informant interviews OVC partners expressed concern at the manner in which HIV status of children and their parents is disclosed to children and indicated that clinical staff are often not trained on age-appropriate disclosure communication. Even when children’s status is known, children often fail to access or adhere to treatment due to lack\nof knowledge on drug use and dosage, drug-sharing within families and/or lack of oversight and attention from parents.\n\n• Sexual violence and HIV. \nMost OVC partners understood the linkages between sexual violence and HIV transmission and recognized that child sexual abuse requires both a legal and medical response. That said, not all partners were aware of the 72-hour window for PEP.\n\n• Coordination. \nCoordination between community-based OVC and facility-based care and treatment partners is very limited, although care and treatment partners were receptive to increasing collaboration with the social  service sector. Para social workers and other social welfare actors would benefit from some training on HIV to support pediatric enrollment and\nadherence. Both OVC and care and treatment programs need to identify areas of intersection, whereby both can leverage their comparative expertise to ensure that more children and families are reached with care and treatment services and the social welfare support they need. \n\nUnder SUNRISE-OVC and other projects within the OVC portfolio, USAID programming has resulted in improved coordination and working relationships between government and civil society organizations, as well as across USAID projects. This development is evidenced by a growing number of formal and informal relationships between institutions and projects. Opportunities for further alignment remain – ensuring projects work within and understand government  planning cycles for the fiscal year starting July 1st would help to support OVC priorities within government plans. Likewise more direct leadership to promote coordination by USAID could incentivize partners to align work plans and foster new types of collaboration between implementing partners, particularly OVC and care and treatment partners.

      "Key Recommendations": "The recommendations provided below address key findings of both the SWOT analysis of the USAID OVC Strategy for Uganda as well as the specific technical areas requested by the Mission. Recommendations were developed in a way to address both issues in a holistic and coordinated manner rather than\nseparately.\n\n1. Provide a common language, understanding and approach towards social service system strengthening and child protection amongst USAID and implementing partners that reflect global guidance and national laws, policies and tools.\na. Develop a standardized description of a social service systems strengthening approach based on 2012 PEPFAR OVC Guidance, inclusive of a standardized or agreed upon child protection training for all USAID funded OVC implementing partners.\nb. Encourage IP management participate in a brief management-level orientation on social services, system strengthening and child protection that would assist them to give appropriate support to staff, utilizing existing expertise within Makerere University, Africhild Research Centre and other technical experts.\nc. USAID should consider requiring IPs to use standardized national tools to ensure consistency in targeting methods and reporting across projects whilst also providing venues to leverage IP expertise through constructive engagement with government in an effort to enhance\nnational tools.\n\n2. Actively promote further discussion and IP engagement with government around the issue of graduation.\na. USAID and the Government of Uganda may want to consider convening a technical working group to think through the complex set of issues involved. This could include defining graduation in its different contexts, how to measure it, and what level of resiliency can be\nanticipated over what period of time.\nb. Graduation strategies should be part and parcel of IP sustainability plans.\nc. Convene a multi-sectoral technical working group on graduation with the objective to clarify definitions and updated guidelines and tools based on IP experience in Uganda and elsewhere.\nd. To facilitate graduation, ensure robust household economic strengthening is included in mechanisms to support vulnerable children and households.\n\n3. Identify, better understand and promote effective models of case management and referral mechanisms amongst implementing partners, other service providers and government as well as amongst social welfare and health/HIV sectors.a. Conduct operations research to identify the best referral models/forms, document and scale, including the Bantwana case management model.\nb. Support the development and roll out of agreed upon and evidence-based standard operating procedures for case management.\nc. Encourage IPs to use existing tools (e.g., MEASURE and QI) to assess, monitor and improve referral networks.\nd. Define the business processes for case management prior to adopting an electronic case management system or adapting the OVC MIS. There may be lessons learned from Child Helpline.\n\n4. A growing evidence base illustrates the linkages between HIV affected and infected children and increased vulnerability to child  protection risks as well as the increased risk of HIV faced by child survivors of child protection violations. USAID Uganda is in a unique position to strengthen and facilitate improved coordination between OVC and social welfare system strengthening efforts and care and treatment partners and promote synergies between child protection and HIV programming, wherever possible.\na. Ensure facility-based counselors/social workers have linkages with community-based service providers.\nb. Leverage existing PLHIV support groups, expert clients, VHTs and para social workers to encourage parents/caregiver to access HCT and ART for children.\nc. Add a module into the child protection and para social worker trainings to ensure Community Development Officers (CDOs) and para social workers have basic knowledge in PEP, ART adherence, disclosure, stigma, available resources and identification of children at risk of HIV and HIV+ children.\nd. Encourage care and treatment partners to include a social work position within health facilities and/or to actively link with para social workers, CDOs and PWOs to foster cross referral of potential child protection cases identified in HIV/health clinics and/or HIV cases\nidentified by child protection sector. This can and should include the development of a training module for doctors, nurses and other health facility staff to recognize signs of abuseor neglect in children.\ne. Support care and treatment providers to develop and implement child safeguarding policies as is expected by OVC partners. \n\n5. Increase access to HIV testing, treatment and care especially amongst children and adolescents. \na. Encourage care and treatment partners to better understand the role that the care environment and neglect has on adherence amongst children and adolescents. For example, many children are living with extended family or elderly caregivers and because of stigma and/or neglect are not able to receive medical care and treatment. Many of these families are vulnerable and could be part of the social worker’s caseload thereby requiring improved coordination and communication between the social welfare and health sectors.\nb. Support child and adolescent friendly clinics and support groups.\nc. Support the recruitment and training of clinic-based staff with skills to work with children and adolescents.\nd. Leverage expert clients, para social workers, VHTs and other community-based structures to support adherence.\n\n6. Strengthen coordination mechanisms amongst USAID, Implementing Partners and the Government of Uganda.a. Using its convening power, USAID could create a collaboration and coordination platform leveraging the strengths of each mechanism to advance OVC objectives (as a complement tothe National OVC Steering Committee).\nb. Create opportunities for joint work planning across USAID OVC and USAID non-OVC mechanisms and the GOU.\nc. Continue to support DOVCCs and DOPs as an effective means of coordination at the district level.\n\n7. Aim to reduce the number of implementing partners focusing on those with the technical skills and foci identified in the PEPFAR  Guidance for OVC Programming, with particular focus on those that have experience and expertise in system strengthening, household economic strengthening, child protection, workforce development and case management and referral systems. \na. Try to avoid funding small, OVC components as additions to larger non-OVC focused project and instead focus on funding of projects within projects that are led by organizations with experience and expertise that is relevant to OVC priority areas. \nb. Encourage implementing partners to engage with and seek information from globally recognized entities with technical expertise e.g., Global Social Service Workforce Alliance, RIATT, etc.",

      "Key Findings": "Partner communities in Senegal chose a variety of focus subjects, or core questions, for the GGB. Examples include health sector governance, education sector governance, environmental management, land management, conflict management, and financial management. While quantitative scores are easy to digest, improvements in numbers cannot tell the full story of GGB impact in partner communities. Those numbers are tied to tangible improvements in governance, service delivery to citizens, and overall quality of life. Selected results follow.\n\nHEALTH\nIn the rural community of Sabodala, GGB analysis identified a dysfunctional health committee as a major weakness in health sector governance. The GGB action plan called for the revitalization of a functional and well-trained health committee with members appointed by consensus. This committee facilitated the opening of a new health center in the community with a dedicated bank account and two new nurses. The health committee appointed an independent treasurer in charge of revenue management. This newfound energy and transparency led to new opportunities for partnership and resources. Mining companies active in the area saw the health committee as a responsible partner and invested in the training and hiring of new midwives. They also donated medicines to the health center and agreed on a quarterly grant for the health sector in Sabodala. In the rural community of Thienaba, GGB analysis identified poor health center management as a major weakness. \n\nThe GGB action plan called for a complete overhaul of health center procedures. Purchasing and inventory practices were particularly problematic, with little regard for record keeping, budgeting or separation of duties. According to a local official, “People now have steady access to the medicines they need. Our health center managers now consult the health committee before making financial transactions, especially the treasurer. All invoices for purchases are on file and available for review. Our budgeting and record keeping practices are standard. Today, thanks to the support of PGP, our health clinic managers and health committees have new knowledge and management tools. I can say that they have better control of their roles and responsibilities. From my point of view, we’re making a lot of progress in the management of the health sector.”\n\nCONFLICT MANAGEMENT/NATURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT\nIn the rural community of Diende, competition over land and water resources is a major source of conflict. The GGB analysis identified poor or nonexistent resource management mechanisms as a major weakness. The GGB action plan called for the construction of a communal pastoral well dedicated to watering livestock, the clear demarcation of paths for livestock movement, and the creation of community dialogue commission for the resolution of conflict.

      "Key Findings": "The evidence suggests that significant efforts will be necessary to acquire financing. The total amount of international public finance for LEDS in the AFOLU sector – as for climate change more generally – is likely to fall short of expectation, and will not be sufficient to fund the\nambitious goals set by many developing countries. At the same time, the limited public finances that are available often remain undisbursed due to the lack of investment-ready projects or questions over financial management capacities and safeguards implementation.",
      "Key Recommendations": "The landscape of finance available for LEDS in the AFOLU sector is complex and diverse.\nWhile many LEDS proponents will be tempted to seek only familiar sources of financing, the\nbenefits for those who seek to cast their net wider are likely to be considerable. Taking this\npath will not be without challenges. In the first place, LEDS proponents will need to familiarize\nthemselves with the finance landscape relevant to their jurisdiction and the sectors and sub-\nsectors they operate within. They will need to establish connections with a broader range of\nactors and understand their interests and concerns. In many cases, they will need to take a\nrisk in pursuing a strategy that has yet to be tested.\n\nThe challenges inherent in financing LEDS mean that financing considerations must be at the\nheart of LEDS design. Proponents should not first design their LEDS and then seek financing,\nbut rather design strategies based around the kinds and amounts of finance available.\nSimilarly, involving potential funders at an early stage is crucial to ensuring that strategies are\nsuitably designed and also ensures that funders become invested at an early stage. In this\nsense, low-emission development strategies and LEDS funding strategies must be considered\nas two sides of the same coin, and integrated from the start.",

      "Document Title": "Namibia Program Profile",
      "Key Findings": "Partnership with the private sector is critical for Namibia to reach the UNAIDS goal of 90-90-90. Assuming stable incidence and using current coverage estimates, Namibia will need to expand treatment coverage by 150 percent to reach an additional 180,000 Namibians, while continuing to sustain the 120,000 PLHIV currently on ART. Lessons learned in Namibia will inform future private sector partnerships and domestic resource mobilization to facilitate the achievement of this goal. Creating an enabling environment for collaboration is critical to supporting a partnership with the private sector. Governments in many sub-Saharan African countries are hesitant to work with the private health sect or, either because they are unaware of potential opportunities or because they are opposed to such engagement on principle. The Shops experience in Namibia demonstrated that such reluctance can be overcome and an enabling environment built through targeted advocacy. Several activities supported this success. As a neutral broker, SHOPS was able to engage both government and private sector stakeholders to begin dialogue and build trust between the two sectors. This dialogue was supported by high quality information, both on regional PPP experiences and potential opportunities specific to Namibia. \n\nThese efforts helped show both sectors how PPPs can be mutually beneficial and support the achievement of priority health goals. By identifying and supporting a pilot PPP opportunity with a high chance of success (Mister Sister), SHOPS built momentum and expertise in the health system to manage and implement PPPs. Corporate-NGO pilots demonstrate potential for commercializing NGO offerings, but additional investments in technical assistance are needed. Donors interested in stewarding successful NGO commercialization may need to encourage NGOs to consider revenue diversification strategies as PEPFAR transitions because they will require technical assistance related to these types of strategies. The SHOPS pilot found that NGOs require marketing capacity, pricing support, negotiation skills, and support for the development of monitoring and evaluation systems that meet the needs of both corporations and donors. Without the additional technical assistance, the pilots would not have been as successful and revenues would not have exceeded NGO services. Mobile clinics offer an important opportunity to expand access to testing, care, and treatment, but targeted demand creation in priority regions is necessary. With the majority of PLHIV living in remote areas, Namibia can benefit from innovative and cost-effective methods to reach these populations. Mobile clinics are strategically positioned to provide efficient and low cost health services on behalf of both government and private sector partners. However, expanding access to services through mobile clinics will require geographic targeting to reach vulnerable populations and behavior change campaigns to encourage health-seeking decisions and build demand for HIV services. \n\nWhile SHOPS ‘experience with Mister Sister was a successful Proffering some needed low cost health services (such as immunization, antenatal care, and treatment of acute illnesses) in hard-to-reach areas, it did not achieve high rates of HIV testing. This was likely due to the selection of regions for Mister Sister outreach. While the regions selected in partnership with the MoHSS were critical to expand access to services for the general population, they were not necessarily regions with the largest populations of PLHIV. Using existing systems and incentives can provide needed private sector data routinely and reliably. Before the SHOPS program, Namibia’s public and private sector systems operated completely independently of one another and, consequently, the private sector’s contribution to the national HIV response was not well known or fully integrated in national reports. To understand the impact of HIV services in the private sector, it is critical for clinicians to report on the types of services provided for patients and identified HIV indicators while protecting patient confidentiality. SHOPS supported activities that leveraged existing mechanisms to ensure sustainability of reporting. For example, working in partnership with the NAMAF provided Shops with access to data from all medical aid funds operating in Namibia.\n\n Through this partnership, SHOPS was able to access data on HIV service coverage such as testing, CD4 counts, viral load testing, male circumcisions, and ARV coverage through the private sector. While medical aid funds were unwilling to share data because of concerns about the use of those data, the NAMAF’s role in the industry and its commitment to assuring anonymity of shared data allowed SHOPS—and therefore, key partners such as the MoHSS and USAID—to have access to private sector data for key indicators.  Moreover, by incorporating VMMC reporting requirements with resupply of male circumcision kits, SHOPS was able to regularly collect these data from private health providers participating in McCelvey. Ultimately, the inclusion of the private sector data into national reporting provides a broader understanding of the HIV response and progress toward an AIDS-free generation. Working with private sector peer-supported networks provides opportunities to understand doctor-patient relationships and how they impact the demand for HIV services. Through the coordination of a network of private clinicians providing VMMC, SHOPS supported the sharing of lessons learned among providers relating to patient engagement. In particular for HIV services with limited demand—like VMMC—it was helpful for providers to share strategies about how to engage and educate patients on the benefits of services. The opportunity for these doctors to work together improved their approach to patients and supported the scale-up of VMMC.",

      "Key Findings": "Focused provider training, combined with demand creation, is a powerful tool for encouraging providers to introduce new clinical methods. The SHOPS trainings offered to private providers led to positive results in overcoming existing barriers for introducing new clinical methods, such as implants and IUDs, as well as utilizing ORS and zinc to combat childhood diarrhea. This training offers great potential, particularly given a recent policy change in Nigeria that now allows community health extension workers to provide LARCs—thus making it easier to expand access for women to these methods in underserved areas and demonstrating the government’s commitment to improving access to family planning. Moving forward, SHOPS is exploring how to incorporate this cadre into LARC trainings. When combined with increased demand generation efforts for these services, enhanced results are evident. With Nigeria’s low levels of contraceptive prevalence and family planning uptake, particularly for LARCs, demand generation is essential to sustain providers’ interest and their confidence in their skills to provide these new services and methods. As such, SHOPS increased individual-and facility-level demand generation efforts to reach clients in providers’ catchment areas, using a combination of community outreach and effective counseling. Use of SMS technology offers a cost-effective way of reinforcing training and increasing efficiencies in commodity logistics. Implementation has shown that use of SMS after training allows providers to ask questions and obtain added information regarding family planning service provision. \n\nEffective linkages were also made between PPMVs and zinc suppliers using SMS. Many PPMVs took advantage to request additional stock of zinc. In addition, during supportive supervision, inspectors were able to assess ORSand zinc stocks using their smartphones and immediately notify SHOPS of stockouts. Both of these channels allowed the distribution system to efficiently pinpoint providers in need of stock and immediately respond. Microfinance institutions, supported by DC credit guarantees, offer critical opportunities for smaller providers to access credit and expand their services. While DCA guarantees do not typically involve microfinance institutions, the DCA credit guarantee with AMfB demonstrated that these guarantees can facilitate impressive gains for small providers, especially community pharmacists who obtained loans from microfinance institutions. AMfB quickly reached its lending ceiling under the DCA agreement and continued strong lending to the health sector even without the guarantee. Through this mechanism, SHOPS demonstrated the value in working with financial intermediaries to extend credit to small providers, who are often not served due to their more limited borrowing needs, even by banks with a DCA guarantee.\n",

      "Document Title": "Tanzania Program Profile",
      "Key Findings": "A number of lessons were learned from the Shops program in Tanzania that can inform future private health sector development. Gathering and widely disseminating health information is fundamental for developing informed interventions and partnerships. Stakeholders from all levels and sectors of the health system require access to concise, accurate, and usable data to develop informed interventions and partnerships. Information at the national level is of little use if it does not reach those who can apply it at the local level. SHOPS made great strides in expanding access to data for decision making; the private sector assessment, facilitated stakeholders ‘dialogues, diagnostic directory, and policy and technical documents all contributed to Tanzania’s body of knowledge. SHOPS’s efforts to build a general consensus in developing these documents and widely disseminate the findings directly supported partnership building and improved access to essential HIV services. These early successes strongly suggest a need for continued efforts to ensure that information is packaged to promote partnerships and are distributed to public and private stakeholders at all levels of the health system. District-level public-private partnership can facilitate alliances when supported by a neutral broker. Public-private partnerships at the local level require open and transparent dialogue among public and private stakeholders. As evidenced by SHOPS’s efforts in Njombe and Dar es Salaam, a neutral broker can support the early stages of engagement by addressing the communication gap between the sectors, facilitating meetings, and ensuring that participants have access to necessary policies, guidance, and information on structuring partnerships.\n The private sector is an important source of health services that can be more effectively leveraged through greater involvement in local planning and funding processes. Public-private partnerships are more likely to be successful when clearly aligned with existing planning processes. Historically, Tanzania’s private health sector has been excluded from contributing to the annual comprehensive council health planning process and other local planning processes because district health authorities viewed PPPs as outside their regular mandate. Achieving and sustaining successful partnerships between the sectors require efforts to align incentives and jointly develop action plans and implementation approaches. Ongoing efforts should focus on better integrating the private sector in planning and funding cycles at the regional and district levels to ensure that all resources are adequately employed to meet district health goals. National policies and guidelines that formalize task sharing can lead to rapid increases in service coverage and improved patient outcomes. Tanzania has historically engaged in task sharing to address HRH shortages. These efforts were informal and did not systematically address human resource needs.\n Formal policies maximize potential gains from task sharing while legally protecting providers offering services outside their regular scope. SHOPS’s work in formalizing a scope of practice for Tanzania’s nurses and midwives generated consensus around the cadres ‘responsibilities and helped to focus and scaleup formal task-sharing activities. The new scope extended service coverage, broadened the reach of the health system to previously under-served areas, and reduced the burden on physicians and overwhelmed points of care. Improving HIV and AIDS patient outcomes at the facility level requires both provider capacity building efforts and targeted health systems strengthening interventions. PEPFAR 3.0, which aims to help achieve an AIDS-free generation by targeting the response to the epidemic, prioritizes scaling up facility-level provision of essential HIV prevention, testing, and treatment services. Capacity-building efforts, such as service delivery trainings and increasing the availability of data for decision making, are critical to improving the availability and quality of facility-level HIV service provision. However, rapid scale up of quality HIV services also requires additional interventions across multiple elements of the health system. For the private sector, this includes access to controlled public sector commodities such as ARVs, consistent and accurate reporting of health data, and strong referral and communication links between public and private providers. As SHOPS’s experience in Tanzania reveals, successfully harmonizing of multiple health systems areas can lead to rapid scale up of HIV service delivery and promote improved patient outcomes.\n",

Further lessons from this case study include:\n•\tAnticipate institutional challenges to sustain cities' internal capacity for climate change. \n•\tEngage and retain the right municipal staff. \n•\tFind advocates for urban resilience. \n•\tLeverage the value of working groups.\n•\tEngage the private sector with a distinct strategy. \n•\tTake advantage of opportunities to introduce climate considerations into decision making.\n•\tBuild ownership and accountability to ensure ongoing work on climate resilience. \n•\tDevelop modular components that can be applied to tailor tools. \n•\tUse decision-ready climate information\n•\tConsider short-term and long-term options in an adaption portfolio. \n•\tCreate peer learning opportunities to promote knowledge transfer--but ensure that resources are available to sustain momentum.\n•\tInvest in pilot selection\n•\tBuild flexible design and city-identified priorities into pilot projects. \n•\tComplement pilot activities by supporting local institutions and experts in an actively managed grant process.\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. Develop practical approaches to evaluate the net benefits or cost-effectiveness of adaptation\noptions. City officials generally understand the existing vulnerabilities in their infrastructure systems,\nbut they lack approaches for quantifying the costs of future, uncertain climate impacts and the\nbenefits of adaptation options to reduce those risks. Cities need better approaches, skills, and\ninformation that: (i) allow them to project the cost of future impacts from existing cost information\nand past events; (ii) apply climate information to account for uncertainty in the magnitude, frequency,\nand damage from future events, (iii) estimate the costs of adaptation options, and (iv) develop\nfinancial metrics, such as net present value, internal rate of return, or cost-effectiveness that can help\nthem select adaptation options.\n2. Translate climate projections into decision-ready information and disseminate it to cities.\nCollecting and interpreting information on future changes in climate remains one of the largest stumbling blocks to building urban resilience. Future efforts should continue to focus on helping\ncities: (i) identify authoritative climate information available for their region or city, (ii) translate data\non climate change into terms that relate to impacts, metrics, and thresholds that they understand, (iii)\napply this information consistently across municipal functions, and (iv) update data sources with new\ninformation as it comes available. Cities need better strategies for making robust decisions with\nimperfect climate information that may not provide enough resolution or certainty to fully inform\ndecisions. Information technologies, including Geographic Information Systems (GIS), Web-based\napplications, and data visualization tools, play an important role in helping cities access and interpret\nclimate information.\n3. Develop modular components to design tools that are tailored to cities’ own local contexts.\nCities need tools that are tailored to their own municipal decision-making processes. Rather than\ntrying to develop a generic one-size-fits-all approach, CRIS demonstrated the value of developing\nmodular tools that build on common resources and can be scaled to other contexts. These tools were\nbest suited to the pilots for which they were developed, but common components were developed\nthat were useful across tools. These components included climate indicators, climate information\nsummaries, climate stressor-asset relationships, adaptation option libraries, ranking systems, and\nadaptation option evaluation approaches. Instead of disseminating specific, tailored tools that do not\nscale well to other contexts, practitioners should focus on defining and sharing modular components\nthat can be combined to generate specific outputs that align with municipalities’ own decision-\nmaking processes.\n4. Link municipal-level adaptation strategies to provincial and national planning. Cities need to\nbetter leverage funding, resources, capacity, and planning at regional and national levels to support\nadaptation. Donors and practitioners should focus on making these linkages, and can encourage\ncollaboration through peer learning events and activities and by implementing programs that help\ncities and regional actors work together. This vertical collaboration can help mainstream climate\nissues into regional land and watershed management activities, and ensure consideration of urban\nissues as regional strategies are developed. Associations of municipalities are key allies that can help\npromote municipal issues at regional and national levels. Through peer learning opportunities, cities\nmay discover opportunities to cooperate on addressing common issues, increasing their impact at\nprovincial and national levels while improving attractiveness of projects to international funders.\n5. Target the private sector in urban climate resilience strategies. The CRIS program’s focus was\non building municipal capacity, but the private sector actors are also critical financers and developers\nof city infrastructure. Future programs should test the effectiveness of engaging the private sector as\na primary means of promoting urban resilience, and compare this approach with programs focused\non local governments. Practitioners and donors should also encourage better collaboration between\nmunicipalities and the private sector, through peer learning or by mainstreaming climate\nconsiderations into municipal oversight of private sector activities and services (e.g., permitting,\nenvironmental impact assessments, and consultant terms of reference). Municipalities should\ncontinue to explore innovative structures for financing resilient infrastructure through the private\nsector.",

      "Key Recommendations": "To officially close the event, Mrs. Fanny Kachale, Director of Reproductive Health at the Ministry of Health in Malawi expressed thanks for the opportunity to hold the meeting and to participate in the successful event. Adam Slote of USAID noted that going forward there is a need to work together to strengthen country ownership and develop national strategies and regulatory frameworks as well as further development of enterprise architecture and standards, and emphasizing interoperability. He encouraged attendees to work together to develop and implement a digital health learning agenda of: effectiveness at scale; cost-effectiveness; vertical health interventions; as well as cross-cutting health systems interventions. The following country teams and organizations received awards for categories voted on by attendees: Kenya and Angola for Best Country Team Presentations, Nigeria and Medic Mobile for Best Gallery Walk Booths, and Malawi for the country with Best Overall Participation. Government leadership working in collaboration with public and private stakeholders can enable a comprehensive and coordinated country digital health system and achieve economies of scale.

      "Key Findings": "• Approaches implemented under the DBTA/STAR programs: The most successful approaches toward strengthening the institutional, management, and human capacity of CSOs and local governments to deliver health services included mentorship and training, integration of HIV/AIDS and TB services at lower-level health facilities, establishment of community linkages for HIV/AIDS and TB services, a commodity-tracking system to reduce stock outs, and the strengthening of laboratory services.\n\n• The effect of transition: Transition of direct implementation of district-led healthcare management activities from the STARs projects to district grants through SDS was more difficult in STAR-EC and STAR-E. In these regions, SDS was preceded by the STAR projects, whereas in STAR-SW, SDS was launched together with the STAR project, resulting in better collaboration during early implementation.\n\n• Sustainability: The STAR program developed and strengthened management and technical structures at the local-government and health-facility levels.\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. To strengthen DBTA capacity-building approaches, design future DBTA projects to address the strengthening of multiple components of the health system, since many factors affect technical assistance uptake.\n2. Clearly delineate roles, responsibilities, and programmatic parameters among multiple programs working in the same district to improve coordination and collaboration.\n3. Invest in developing the leadership capacity of existing health management committees (HMC) at the health-facility level to improve the quality assurance linkage between the health services and the communities served.\n4. In collaboration with the DBTA’s participating districts, establish and maintain a database to determine the extent of cost sharing among districts, with reference to DBTA interventions to improve long-term sustainability.\n5. Continue to support maintenance and utilization of the LQAS methodology for data collection, strategic planning, and improvement of programs.",

      "Key Findings": "U.S. agencies have sought to address causes of unaccompanied alien child (UAC) migration through recent programs, such as information campaigns to deter migration, developed in response to the migration increase and other long-standing efforts. The recent migration increase was likely triggered, according to U.S. officials, by several emergent factors such as the increased presence and sophistication of human smugglers (known as coyotes) and confusion over U.S. immigration policy. Officials also noted that certain persistent conditions such as violence and poverty have worsened in certain countries. In addition to long-standing efforts, such as U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) antipoverty programs, agencies have taken new actions. For example, Department of Homeland Security (DHS)-led investigative units have increasingly sought to disrupt human smuggling operations.",
      "Key Recommendations": "GAO recommends that DHS and State take steps to integrate evaluations into their planning for, and implementation of, future information campaigns intended to deter migration. GAO also recommends that DHS establish performance targets for its investigative units. DHS concurred with both recommendations, and State concurred with the one recommendation directed to it.",

Ventures with at least one-woman founder tend to report (slightly) higher revenue and employment levels. However, when it comes to attracting equity investment, they lag behind ventures with all-male founding teams; especially when they have prior entrepreneurial experience and when they work in the developed world. A closer look at the figures in this brief, however, suggests that the most problematic outcomes are found among ventures with all-women founding teams. These 325 ventures lag behind the other three categories when it comes to revenue and employment generation, and when it comes to attracting early-stage equity and debt financing. They also tend to launch ventures with less prior entrepreneurial experience and tend to have the hardest time getting into accelerator programs. To the extent that we believe there is promise in these ventures – along with the other ventures with at least one-woman founder – we must think about how to ensure that this promise is realized.",

      "Key Recommendations": "Prioritization and Likely Strategic Impacts\nTourism development can diversify Timor-Leste’s economy but cannot quickly provide significant local benefit unless\nlocal populations (and tourism officials) are up-skilled and conditioned to working in a tourist-friendly, service-driven\neconomy. Priority needs to be given to training. In addition, the scheduling of tourism development through national\nand regional master planning in a logical and strategic manner as access is improved needs to be considered. The regu-\nlation of tourism and enforcement of development conditions will need to be strengthened. Marketing is also a key\nstrategic need. Without it demand is unlikely to grow.\n\nGovernment needs to plan the development of tourism particularly in relation to compatible land uses, water manage-\nment, coastal zone management and the development of marine parks and protected areas. It should integrate tourism\nwithin the existing cultural and environmental constraints and opportunities.\n\nThe government must ensure that tourism development and environmental management are mutually supportive. It\nneeds to identify and help the private sector develop facilities to meet specific niche markets, particularly in eco-tour-\nism, nature and cultural tourism, and involve local populations in the identification and management of natural pro-\ntected areas set aside for eco-tourism.\n\nGovernment should facilitate efforts, at the national and district levels, to assess the likely overall impact of the eco-\nnomic, social and ecological aspects of tourism, to plan sustainable tourism and to develop both eco- and cultural tourism.\n\nVarious scenarios can be put forward for growth, depending on the extent to which the government commits to busi-\nness climate improvement, marketing, product development and environmental protection. The speed at which tour-\nism develops and job creation occurs will largely be determined by the growth of the accommodation sector. If the Pelican development goes ahead as planned for example, national room supply (and direct tourism jobs) will increase\nby 33%. However much infrastructure and marketing will be needed to attract investments to areas away from Dili\n\nGiven the constraints and lack of strategic focus in development and marketing, an annual expansion rate of 10-15%\nwould seem realistic. If strategic marketing, improved access, market research, training and targeted investor sourcing\ntakes place based around a themed/branded approach to development, the pace of growth could be accelerated con-\nsiderably.",

      "Key Findings": "• Nearly 5.3 million tons of CO2 were sequestered, as a result of IFACS-led activities to improve forest management and restore deforested areas\n• All 11 districts now have spatial plans incorporating recommendations from LEDS-based Strategic Environmental Assessments (SEAs)• All 11 districts now have operational MSFs, which are becoming lively and inclusive venues for multi-stakeholder collaboration and participation, thereby improving the transparency of land-use planning and management in the landscapes\n• 12,728 people (106% of the target value) are receiving economic benefits from LEDS activities promoted by IFACS in the landscapes\n• Five forest carbon finance concept notes that allow for investors to buy and save carbon offsets have been prepared for initiatives in Aceh (2), West Kalimantan, Central Kalimantan, and Papua\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "LESTARI and future development projects should seek to ensure SEA-LEDS and LCP recommendations are applied in focal district policies, programs and plans. This will require\na process wherein PPPs (such as the mid-term development plan or strategic program of district offices) are guided by the SEA-LEDS and LCP recommendations coming from the\nMSFs. Technical assistance should ensure that a proper and thorough methodology for this integration is developed by local district governments. Also important is a protocol for\ntransparent spatial planning monitoring that will aim to ensure adherence to SEA –LEDS recommendations. This is especially critical where spatial plans have already been ratified\nby a government decree. Even though areas may be under a land-use designation that could result in deforestation, the monitoring protocol can help to mitigate environmental\nimpact in line with SEA-LEDS recommendations. IFACS and future development projects can help by facilitating communication of these documents and processes at the national level to gain support from the Ministry of Home Affairs, Ministry of Forestry and Ministry of Environment.",

      "Key Recommendations": "• Align project design with government planning cycles.\n• Design for coordination and synergy between inter-related projects.\n• Continue to support social welfare workforce development.\n• Formalize and expand support supervision activities.\n• The MGLSD should merge and harmonize the work of community-based child protection structures into a single structure of para social workers (PSW) with a functional identity",

      "Key Findings": "This chapter reviewed both macroeconomic data on the employment, output and growth of industrial sectors in the Egypt National Income Accounts, and information obtained through two surveys of key informants among economic and business experts and among owners and managers of businesses. A pattern emerged from both sources of information. The sectors that have made the largest percentage contribution to the growth of Egypt's GDP over the period 2011/2012 to 2012/2013 are the following: \n• Agriculture, Irrigation & Fishery\n• Manufacturing Industries\n• Primarily Other Manufacturing\n• Wholesale & Retail Trade\n• General Government\n• Construction & Building\n• Restaurants & Hotels (related to Tourism)\n• Communications\n• Transportation & Storage\n• Education, Health & Personal Services\n• Real Estate Activities\n• Social Solidarity\n• Brokerage & Subsidiary Activities\n• Real Estate Property\n• Electricity\n\nSectors expected by the panel of Egyptians knowledgeable about the economy as highly likely to make a significant contribution to growth of Egypt's economy in the intermediate future include the following:\n• Tourism\n• Manufacturing Industries – Others\n• Suez Canal (operations)\n• Agriculture, Irrigation & Fishing\n• Transportation & Storage\n• Construction & Building\n• Communications (telephone and IT services)\n• Electricity\n\nBased on these sources of information, and reviews of Government of Egypt priorities, we selected 11 sectors and subsectors as the focus of the study and further information gathering.These are:\n• Agriculture, Irrigation & Fishing\n• Oil & Gas Production (Mining)\n\nWithin Manufacturing Industries• Building Materials\n• Engineered Products\n• Food Processing\n• Textiles and Apparel\n• Electricity\n• Construction & Building\n• Transportation & Storage\n• Communications (telephone and ICT)\n• Tourism\n\nSectors named by respondents to the surveys as sectors with the most potential to affect economic growth, which are constrained by a lack of professional/technical skills, included: \n• Manufacturing\n• Agriculture\n• Tourism\n• Construction\n• Health\n• Communication & IT\n• Education\n• Oil & gas\n• Energy\n• Engineering\n• Transportation\n\nFour fields of university or technical college education appeared in numerous responses to different survey questions. For example the fields identified most frequently by business owners/managers who planned to expand their workforce in the next 12-24 months were:\n• Business (commerce, banking, marketing, accounting, management)\n• Engineering\n• Computer science\n• Natural science (physics, chemistry, biology, zoology, botany, astronomy)\n\nThese same fields appeared on virtually every inquiry about the skills required by businesses that have the potential to contribute to the growth of the Egyptian economy. The following chapters investigate institutions of the Egyptian higher education system to ascertain if those institutions have the capacity to meet this expressed need, and what they believe they are doing to meet that need.\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "Specifically needed in the near term are occupational forecasts commensurate with what have been reported as sectors of high-growth potential. This can be communicated to MOHE with the intention of promoting enrollment into those disciplines that would prepare students for careers in those fields. We encourage USAID to support further examinations by the MOHE into these areas that should:\n\n• Lead to the creation of new academic programs;\n• Place an increased emphasis on existing programs that do align with high-growth economic sectors;\n• Create greater alignment to industry needs by making required adjustments/modifications to those existing programs in high-growth sectors; and\n• Synchronize these efforts based on the data that are available in this report, plus any related information that is available from local sources such as the Central Agency for Public Mobilization and Statistics (CAPMAS) and the Ministry of Manpower & Migration (MOMM).",

Scaling‐up local activities into larger frameworks is especially challenging and project timelines are seen as inhibiting long‐term commitments.\n• Lacking are incentives for governments to replicate and scale‐up project‐based efforts, invest in domestic finance, and establish broad coalitions of diverse stakeholders to regulate land and forest use to reduce GHG emissions. \n• Projects are quite successful at engaging stakeholders and initiating implementation activities at local levels but there is a lack of incentive for in‐depth and sustained participation. \n• Direct drivers of forest land use change are well described, but the underlying causes of deforestation and forest degradation are not as well understood.\n",

      "Document Title": "Final Evaluation: African Strategies for Health Project",
      "Key Findings": "• Forty-eight percent of respondents said that ASH performance and results were good to excellent and 75 percent found something of positive value in this project. \n• The ASH project has met,or is on track to meet by the end of the project, all of the output targets identified by USAID. ASH has exceeded the target set for south-to-south dialogue.\n• ASH generated or followed up on 58 ideas with the USAID/ASH core technical team, out of which were produced a total of 62 reports, publications and materials with a focus on some health trends, constraints and solutions for improved African Health; \n• The mHealth compendia and related mHealth work is the most frequently cited product by respondents interviewed, with digital health cited by 22 percent of respondents to be ASH’s most important contribution toward increasing new knowledge through dissemination of lessons learned from country experiences. \n• In terms of reaching the project’s three IRs, 72 percent of the 50 activities analyzed for this report were designed to achieve IR 1 (expanding the body of knowledge or current trends constraints and solutions to improve health), 22 percent were used for IR 2 (advocacy and communications), and only 16 percent went toward strengthening African institutions. The project contributed new ideas and material through evaluations, special studies, publications and conferences (IR 1), supported consensus-building work on specific strategies and approaches through regional meetings and conferences and follow-up with regional partners and WHO/AFRO (IR 2), and advanced the work of a small number of regional African institutions and networks (IR 3) through focused technical assistance and management support. \n• Given the data on hand, it is not possible to draw a causal link between these results and changes in health status. Some of these results however, have contributed to strengthening some health systems, regional health networks such as Roll-Back Malaria (RBM), and regional norms and standards, and have focused attention on key health challenges such as pediatric TB. \n• Despite a slow start and extensive staffing challenges, the project carried out 133 activities over the four years. During the final year that will begin in September 2015, ASH plans to carry out 23 activities, for a life-of-contract total of 156 activities across the region. The Year 5 work plan was under review at the time of this evaluation.\n\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "The evaluation team has identified seven priority recommendations to increase the project’s impact in its final year. Recommendations for Year 5 of the ASH Project \n1. Accelerate widespread, multi-channel product dissemination of completed products and gather user satisfaction and end-use data to learn more about who uses the materials and why. Assure that key stakeholders like WHO/AFRO obtain findings and participate in teleconference meetings.\n 2. Complete the misoprostol, IPTp and iCCM, and SMS studies and channel those findings into well- defined, time-limited actions and results. Share the findings with key stakeholders.\n3. Support key strategic planning work currently underway at WHO/AFRO. Assure that ASH products and materials are widely disseminated to all of the WHO/AFRO clusters, including those that do not currently work with ASH. WHO has an electronic library and ASH should explore if this is an additional channel to disseminate the project’s research and tools.\n4. Prepare a white paper on mHealth that outlines next steps, possible partners and the investment in electronic infrastructure and systems architecture, including memory storage and system bandwidth that is required to move forward region-wide. The report should project the status of country planning for mHealth by the end of 2015. \n5. Document by the end of 2015 any increases in domestic resource mobilization associated or linked to ASH work, including any new private sector investments that may have followed the completion of private sector or mHealth country assessments or new investments by governments in pediatric TB. \n6. As follow-up to the ECOWAS conference in July 2015 in Burkina Faso, which included ASH work on urban health, use APHRC to identify and cost out key next steps to launch urban health services. Link APHRC with ECOWAS so they and other African organizations can conceptualize a plan for integrating better urban health planning across the region.\n7. Consistent with the revised PMP, document the use of ASH materials and institutional or policy changes and agreements reached by the end of the project.\n",

      "Key Recommendations": "Given the diversity of agricultural production in Southern Shan, a number of value chains could potentially benefit from interventions targeted to smallholder farmers in general and women specifically. The project selected coffee and soybean as the first two targeted value chains based on the following selection criteria:\n1. Total number of smallholders\n2. Potential profitability for smallholders (per acre)\n3. Market / commercialization potential\n4. Potential for private sector alliances\n5. Low barriers to entry / ease of entry\n6. Potential for value‐added\n•  Coffee\nThe soil and elevation of Shan State makes it suitable to grow good quality (Arabica) coffee.17 In 2010‐11, Shan State accounted for nearly 44% of the acreage sown for coffee in Myanmar (MNPED 2011), although at around 26,000 acres it is still a relatively small crop. From 2004‐05 to 2010‐11 the acreage devoted to coffee in Shan State grew an average 9.9% per year – slightly faster than the 8.8% average for rest of the country. According to the data from the International Coffee Association (ICO), the domestic coffee market in Myanmar is relatively small, but may have significant growth potential. Per capita consumption is less than one‐third that of Thailand and almost entirely consists of soluble coffee (ICO 2014). Rising incomes, plus increasing tourism, should see an increase in demand. Opportunities exist to export regionally and to Europe. Around 80% of Myanmar’s coffee is produced by smallholders (the average holding is less than 1 acre). It can be grown on slopes and with other crops (such as rubber) because it needs shade. Steps in farming coffee include harvesting, pulping, fermenting, washing, drying, hulling, cleaning, grading, sorting, storing, and transportation. Coffee is largely non‐perishable and can be transported easily. In general, distinct gender roles characterize activities related to coffee production, including postharvest handling and marketing. Overall, women may contribute up to 70% of the total labor involved in the production and processing of coffee beans. They are also key to the value‐added activities that ensure the quality of the coffee production such as careful harvesting and picking only ripe fruit; clean water and hygiene of the pulping, washing, and drying infrastructure; and good timing of the fermentation and drying process. The access to and control of resources and decision‐making, however, are predominantly the domain of men, and women are generally not empowered in these areas of coffee production. Title to coffee land is frequently registered in the name of the male head of household, leading to a perception of coffee as a “man’s crop”. Men also assume the management roles of trading and selling the coffee that, in turn, entitles them to control of the proceeds. Women work primarily as unpaid family labor. Access to related services such as technical training and extension, certification, finance, and market information are frequently targeted to male farmers or are more easily accessible by them due to time, mobility, and education constraints that affect women. Coffee is cultivated at higher elevations that, in the context of Shan State, include ethnic minority areas where the practice of customary land tenure prevails. The intent of the new land legislation, such as VFV Law, is to increase opportunities for private sector development of high‐value agricultural commodities in these upland areas. Statutory land use rights will not be granted to land held in customary tenure. Indigenous smallholders risk being displaced or they may be less able or willing to invest in adopting new technologies on land they may lose. In addition, coffee plantations take several years to mature, which can be particularly challenging in the context of insecure land tenure.\n\n•  Soybean\nThe greater and more regular rainfall of the Shan hills makes it suited to growing soybean. Soybean is one of Shan State’s largest crops (third behind paddy and maize in terms of acres sown). In 2010‐11, over 80% of Myanmar’s soybean acreage was in Shan State. Land devoted to soybean in Shan grew an average 3.4% from 2004‐5 to 2010‐11 – twice as fast as in the rest of the country. The demand for soybean has been largely driven by the growth in poultry production. Animal feed demand for soybean meal is growing and is primarily met by imports: \n• quality of local soybean cake is low; cannot replace imports entirely\n• but protein demand by local poultry and fishery is growing\n• full fat soymeal is produced by commercial feed mills\n\nDemand by soybean food processors(tofu, fermented soybean cake, etc.) is consistent but there is also small but growing demand for soy milk. There are informal trade flows reported to the People’s Republic of China and Thailand (Favre and Myint 2009). Soybean is produced by smallholders as well as mid‐size and large farms. Farmers involved in soybean also grow rice, maize, and niger. Some are also involved in pigeon peas and garlic (Winrock International, undated). The main harvest is during the monsoon18, so drying is a problem, as well as finding labor willing to work at that time (see below). Overall, input cost are relatively low for soybean compared to other crops (maize, rice, garlic) and margins for smallholders are higher than other crops. There is potential to introduce processors for making soybean oil. This can then be made into soybean cake with a screw press. Alternatively, using hexane it can be made into a soybean meal, which is higher in protein than cake and is better feed for poultry layers. But few millers do this and soybean meal is mostly imported. Another method is to add an enzyme to full fat soybean (beans heated, not crushed for oil) to produce meal. This is better for poultry broilers and is the largest meal source for commercial feed mills. But the enzyme is expensive (and imported). There is only one soybean mill and refinery in Taunggyi. Most mills in Taunggyi also process groundnuts from the Dry Zone for local wholesale market. Yields for smallholders could be improved with better practices. Favre and Myint (2009) found that in Shan State, on yar mye, soybean gross margins can be very low because of inefficient land preparation practices. However, in villages where improved cultivation practices have been adopted, soybean gross margins are comparable to groundnut. Potential exists for farmers to benefit from contract farming. Contract farming overcomes problems of access to finance and input use, but many farmers are unable to fully benefit from the model. Farmer cooperatives would have more bargaining power for negotiating contracts. Potential for gender‐specific interventions will depend on the production model targeted by the Value Chains project: large‐scale, commercial production that targets export markets or household‐based production. In fact, with soybean it is possible to have a blended model that combines export and domestic consumption19. With soybean, if a small portion of the harvest is kept for domestic consumption and further processing (for example, making tofu and soy milk), women in particular may benefit from improved storage facilities and more advanced processing techniques.\n\n• Cross‐cutting Recommendations for Gender and Social Inclusion in Value Chains for Rural Development\nThe following section looks at a range of gender issues related to value chain development, the constraints these can impose on women and opportunities for the Value Chains project to initiate pro‐active strategies for women’s empowerment as part of value chain development. Finally, it offerssome guidelinesfor working with rural women20. In rural households in Myanmar, both women and men are actively involved in agricultural production and related economic activities that are essential to support the well‐being of the household, although the specific roles, access to and control of resources and decision‐making are highly engendered. Women’s empowerment will result from increasing their access to and control of resources necessary for their livelihoods as well as strengthening their capacity and opportunities for decision‐making within the household and their communities. The following summarizes the “business case” and the “development case” for focusing training, technical assistance, and other support to strengthen women’s opportunities. Notwithstanding the legal, social, and cultural obstacles that face women, they will tend to increase their productivity and their capacity to contribute to the financial security of the households, as well as gain the confidence and skills to be more pro‐active in their relations within their households and their communities. \n\n\n",

      "Document Title": "Evaluation of HED/USAID Women's Leadership Program-Rwanda",
      "Key Findings": "In September 2013, both National University of Rwanda (NUR) and The Kigali Institute of Education (KIE) ceased to exist as legal entities, and the process of merging five public institutions into one university system was initiated. The revitalization and reformation of higher education is a complex process with a never-changing set of actors. Partnerships must be seen as a process, not a product, so that attention can always be given to the nurturing of the process. The nature of these partnerships must constantly be negotiated and renegotiated so that program goals, priorities, and responsibilities are clearly articulated, and space created for local interpretations and innovation. In spite of complications resulting from the merger, both partnerships have made substantial progress toward achieving its core objectives and intended outcomes and outputs. For URCE the greatest success has been in meeting its second and third objectives: better informed URCE’s institutional policies and practices through gender-focused research and capacity building and improved capacity to prepare teachers to address gender equity in the classroom through pedagogy, course content, and classroom management techniques. For CAVM the greatest success has been in meeting its first and second objectives: strengthened human and institutional capacity of UR in teaching and applied research in agricultural sciences promotion and support women's access to graduate education in agricultural sciences.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Recommendations for WLP Education and Agribusiness\n\n 1. University of Rwanda procurement regulations should be revised with an eye to expediency and efficiency. University and college financial systems and finance personnel must be flexible enough to accommodate the demands and requirements of various regional and international partners. However, donor support of University of Rwanda needs to be better coordinated. The Directorate of Planning and Development can play an instrumental role in building systems for more harmonized support, especially in financial management and reporting systems.\n2. Institutional support at various levels across the colleges and University must be secured and maintained. \n3. UR should collect gender-disaggregated data in whatever they do. This will help it to gauge its gender sensitivity in service delivery.\n4. Gains in institutional capacity have a better chance of being sustained with broad-base support from faculty, staff, and administration. While considerable effort has been made to earn buy-in from all faculty, staff, and administration from the outset, it must remain a priority. \n\nRecommendations for WLP-Education\n\n 1. The URCE partnership implementing team requested an extension of the partnership because there are critical activities pending due to the delay caused by the merger of universities into one university. For example, the outreach program has had little time for implementation. URCE would have benefited from seeing the implementation of all phases of the program: community mobilization, recruitment phase and follow-up. Also, the online platform is a pilot. Implementers and all stakeholders wish to see the outcome, and use lessons learned to improve the developed UR Connect platform. \n2. Mentoring content should be strengthened and more time allocated to the training component. In addition, mentors need motivation to do their job efficiently. They should make themselves known to the college community for students to access them.\n 3. When setting agendas for partnership activities, consider narrower scope of activities. \n4. Improved infrastructure can ensure sustainability of online learning. The government should provide electricity to most remote areas without access. \n5. TTCs are affiliated with URCE. There are should be strategies where URCE can foresee the mentoring and counseling activities. The support may not be monetary. Orientation and a template to track what they are doing may be enough to improve their overall performance. Mentors and counselors should be facilitated by URCE to achieve their goal. Although they are rendering services (recruiting, mentoring and counseling) to students, they are handicapped.\n\n Recommendations for WLP- Agribusiness\n\n 1. Growth of the program must be controlled to ensure quality. The program needs to grow strategically and incrementally. The College will be under pressure to grow the program quickly due to high demand and revenue generation potential. If the program grows too quickly for institutional capacity and, more especially, human resource capacity, the quality of the program will be severely compromised. \n2. A plan for faculty development that allows for more advanced training of its current human resources (lecturers, tutorial assistants, etc.) for higher-level degrees in the field of Agribusiness is crucial. While faculty and staff are pursuing more training, adequate highly-qualified teaching staff must be in place to continue teaching in the program. CAVM should consider regional recruitment for qualified teaching staff to fill in the gaps. Students, especially females, who are excelling in the program should be identified at the end of the first year, and receive extra support and leadership development opportunities. These women could be prepped to pursue doctoral programs abroad, perhaps through the Borlaug program.\n3. As Agribusiness grows in Rwanda, so will employment opportunities for those with appropriate qualifications. CAVM must remain competitive with the private sector at all levels. Teaching faculty must be ensured favorable working conditions, such as competitive wages, manageable teaching load and reduced commuting between campuses. The public sector must also remain competitive with the private sector. If not, graduates of the MSc Agribusiness who are working in the public sector will migrate to private sector companies, essentially resulting in a brain drain in the public sector. \n4. The program of study should be revised so that there are more practical classes in the first two semesters before students begin their 200 hours of internship. Courses such Strategic Management in Agribusiness, Agribusiness Value-Chain Management, and Agribusiness Marketing should be offered during Semester 1 and Semester 2. \n5. Maintaining engagement with the private sector is crucial to ensure that the quality of the program remains high. The relationship between CAVM and the advisory board must continue to be cultivated. The link among private sector, public sector, and the University is crucial to maintaining the quality and relevance of the Agribusiness program, as well as the nation’s development agenda. \n6. The internship and thesis should be integrated. This would raise the overall quality of the program. \n7. A gender specialist within the college is necessary. Ideally, gender specialists would be found on each campus. Resources must be spread across all five campuses. Existing gender committees at Nyagatre and Busgogo must be nurtured. Develop best practices or a handbook for how to integrate gender into the curriculum. \n8. Continued resources must be dedicated to building capacity in career development. The hiring of a career development specialist is a great start. This person will need support staff in order to succeed.\n\n",

      "Key Findings": "Banks and other financial institutions are often reluctant to lend to farmers and agribusinesses because of the perceived risk inherent in such activities, agriculture’s seasonal nature, uncontrollable weather-related events, product perishability and high market volatility of agricultural goods. EATH worked with the Kenya School of Monetary Studies (KSMS) to design a certificate in agricultural finance to strengthen human resource capacity in regional lending institutions, facilitate improved risk analysis/management policies and facilitate additional agricultural sector lending on a sustainable basis. While the majority of participants were drawn from commercial banks, other financial sector institutions, particularly microfinance institutions and agricultural savings and credit cooperatives, also benefitted from the training. EATH, therefore, enabled KSMS to strengthen its capacity building mandate by targeting financial sector institutions historically lacking in human resource capacity to undertake effectively best practice compliant agricultural lending activities. Most of the 204 graduates of the program are now key decision makers in EAC financial institutions.\nTheir presence within these institutions has enabled KSMS to continue to engage productively with the industry and promote progress towards improved lending practices. KSMS staff credit the EATH project with making a demonstrable contribution in terms of increased finance for agricultural sector activities, and with deepening the culture of good lending practices within a number of commercial finance institutions in the EAC and in some countries of Southern Africa. Though EATH support ended in 2012, the program’s strong reputation appears to have helped leverage follow-on funding from other donors (including GIZ and Financial Access). Other sustainability mechanisms that have allowed the program to operate effectively post-EATH include continued co-funding of participants by the school and major financial sector institutions, and demand-side resource leveraging through the KSMS alumni association. EATH also targeted strategic institutional-strengthening needs in the nascent East African insurance industry, particularly with regards to the development of urgently needed agricultural risk assessment and agricultural insurance products.\nTo build institutional capacity in the insurance industry and raise the level and penetration of viable agricultural insurance products across East Africa, EATH worked with the Kenya College of Insurance (KCI) to create a regional certificate of agricultural insurance. The program trained 142 financial and insurance professionals to design viable and affordable crop insurance vehicles and develop efficient claims procedures. Ultimately, the program is intended to mitigate effectively risk for farmers on a large scale, thereby increasing their ability to access financing and improve their nutritional status, and their production and family income outcomes. Since EATH support ended in 2012, at least 25 additional individuals have been trained, and KCI has partnered with the World Bank and the Kenya School of Monetary Studies to continue program activities. However, the certificate is currently offered only at the local campus in Nairobi, Kenya. It has not yet been established at educational/training institutions in other EAC countries which currently limits the replicability and scalability of the initiative.\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. The EATH agricultural finance training programs reached large numbers of trainees and have leveraged in both cases spurred follow-on sponsorship support, as well as direct budgetary support from the sponsoring academic institutions – remarkable sustainability performance. The stakeholders interviewed clearly spoke to the high quality of the training courses proffered and their impact on developing a cadre of agricultural finance professionals ready and able to advocate for and implement innovative agricultural lending and agricultural insurance products and related risk analysis approaches. It might be worth exploring whether the current EATIH initiative, with its major investment leveraging and loan origination focus, might benefit from tapping into the organizational goodwill and alumni contact network created through these training programs, as it operationalizes its financial outreach strategy and prospects for top tier loan origination consultants. \n2. Major resource-leveraging risk mitigation benefits could be leveraged for EATIH stakeholders in key agricultural value chains; if effectively structured and disseminated crop insurance and warehouse receipts related financial products could be effectively applied. It may in this regard be worth exploring the opportunities and constraints (including current EAC legal/regulatory harmonization requirements) for developing/applying well-structured insurance instruments to leverage additional value chain finance for participants within one or more EATIH-supported agricultural sectors; and for in major agricultural finance product areas, such as crop insurance and credit enhancement mechanisms for WHRS instruments.\n",

More companies have embraced the practice, now regularly disclosing their activities to investors and institutionalizing CSR by designating focused staff, developing a business case, integrating into planning and budgets, and by awareness of the need to act in a way that is sustainable as the company changes focus or location. Many companies have also created corporate foundations to manage CSR, which can review and evaluate activities independently of the corporation. The practice has become both strategic, through the development of guiding national working groups, and highly professionalized. A global industry now supports CSR development with training, guidelines, coordination, cooperation, and academic and professional credentials.",

Engage in local business council meetings where groups of\ncompanies from various industries discuss issues related to doing business in that country, including CSR-related issues.\n\n4. Conduct study tours to health-focused CSR sites (e.g. a health\nclinic in a mining community) to learn how companies implement their existing initiatives and identify potential approaches and resources that could be leveraged.\n\n5. Organize a high-level private sector forum or roundtable to introduce USAID to corporations with in-country operations or to discuss a specific development challenge.\n\n6.

      "Key Findings": "The findings point to important early lessons. Overall, we were heartened to see that the report highlights some promising examples of success, and leads us to believe that MSIs – in the right context, and set up well – can play an essential role in helping achieve results at greater scale for a broad cross-section of stakeholders. But the report also says loud and clear to proceed with caution, drawing on experiences of MSIs that did not live up to the bold ambitions of their founders. Moreover, as an additional warning to would-be funders of future MSIs, the GDI team found that (1) none of the profiled MSIs fully cover their costs, even after decades, and (2) most MSIs never close shop. Those considering forming or funding a new MSI, therefore, should expect to be in it for the long haul.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Several overarching key considerations emerged from this review:\n• Proceed with caution - setting up a multi-stakeholder initiative (MSI) is a high-risk venture.\n•  Consider alternatives - before launching an MSI, consider whether an altrnative, less costly, and less risky mechanism is better suited.\n• Timing is everything - even when an MSI is the most appropriate mechanism, carefully consider whether the right conditions are in place for a successful start-up.",

      "Key Findings": "The Alliance has faced many challenges. The program has been a significant management lift for the USAID Mission, as the review and rating of many rounds of proposals require dedicated time and resources from the technical teams. Many new businesses under the Millennium Alliance have required substantial mentoring and technical assistance, especially in monitoring and evaluation, where grantees have limited capacity to build the evidence base for attracting and retaining investors. A dearth of early stage domestic capital has also proved to be an impediment for the young businesses, inhibiting their large-scale impact. Further, enterprises that have brought new technology to BoP markets have struggled to establish reliable networks to service these markets since product maintenance will be unfamiliar for existing infrastructure.",

      "Document Title": "Public-Private Partnership Development Program (P3DP) in Ukraine ",
      "Key Findings": "Approved in August 2013 under CMU Decree #739, the PPP concept sent a clear signal to government and the private sector that PPPs would be a valid mechanism for procuring infrastructure and public services in Ukraine.\n\nP3DP played a significant role in the establishment of MOEDT’s PPP Unit, which provides guidance and support for PPP implementation in Ukraine.\n\nA baseline survey in 2011 and follow-up surveys in 2014 and 2015 showed that knowledge of PPPs in PPP pilot cities increased significantly over the life of the Program.\n\nP3DP served as transaction advisor for two successful PPPs in sports & recreation (2013) and alternative heating with biofuel (2014).\n\nP3DP played an important part in implementing USAID’s Global Climate Change and Development Strategy in Ukraine.",
      "Key Recommendations": "To further PPP development in Ukraine, P3DP recommends that the government, donors, development institutions, NGOs and others with the necessary resources consider the following as they develop strategies for promoting PPP development:\n\n- Maximizing the use of contracting out for services, including those of local small and medium-sized businesses. By bringing in the private sector through management or output-based contracts in the short term, even in cases where government directly finances urgent infrastructure construction (such as roads), both the government and private sector will develop productive working relationships.\n\n- Continuing to build the legislative and institutional framework for PPPs. This will enable the private sector to engage in longer-term projects more quickly once Ukraine has achieved stability, both politically and in terms of renewed conflict with Russia.\n\n- Strengthen PPP institutions, including PIEC, working groups, and PPP programs at business education institutions. These should include governmental bodies as well as major developmental players, including the World Bank Group and USAID.\n\n- Rethinking the role, functions, and structure of the PPP Unit to lead PPP policy and development going forward.\n\n- Explore role of private sector through PPPs for any area where Ukraine faces challenges.\n\n- Maximizing replicable PPPs, for example, in using biofuel as a substitute for Russian natural gas for heating.\n\n- Providing guarantees for government payments to private sector partners (for well-vetted, sound, and economically beneficial PPP projects) to increase the willingness of private operators to engage in PPPs.\n\n- Addressing social needs, such as healthcare or refugee resettlement services for IDPs, through PPP-like arrangements with NGOs.\n\n- Developing media capacity for better coverage of PPP-related issues in the press, as well as include strategic communications in PPP training programs for officials and other practitioners.",

      "Key Recommendations": "1. Representation of impact enterprises across sectors is weak. Barring agriculture, value chains in most sectors with impact enterprise presence are shallow. There are some critical white spaces, highlighting significant opportunity for profitable and innovative models.\n\n2. Transfer of knowledge and resources through South-South collaboration can foster entrepreneurship in East Africa and stimulate further innovation.\n\n3. For the most part, entrepreneurial activity in East Africa is restricted to Kenya. Concerted efforts to build a strong entrepreneurial ecosystem will eventually support a larger number of innovation focused enterprises across the region.",

      "Key Findings": "This report observes the impacts of investment markets in the West African region. The report contains an overview of the West African region, followed by three chapters regarding Senegal, Nigeria, and Ghana. The report also includes information about investment landscapes in Sierra Leone, Cote d’Ivoire, Togo, and Benin. Perceived barriers to deploying impact capital in the region is described.  The report highlights the key perceived opportunities for investment, including the key sectors of energy, financial services, and agriculture.\n\nThe authors identify the need to inform the global community on investment potentials and impacts in West Africa. Because a majority of investment comes from Development Finance Institutions (DFIs), the largest source of impact capital in the region is foreign governments. Within the DFIs, the majority of direct capital deployed is from global and regional participants. Additionally, the study identifies the following perceived barriers to deploying impact capital: \n\n• Investment readiness of target investees due to lack of appropriate personnel, as well as lack of sound financial and business structures that make it difficult for investors to estimate potential future profitability and investment value.\n• Difficulty sourcing capital. Local funders find it difficult to secure domestic financing and instead rely on foreign capital from DFIs. \n• Difficulty exiting equity investments, due to shallow financial markets. \n• Macroeconomic and political instability.\n• Unpredictable regulation. Few regulatory barriers exist in the region for investments, including a general lack of clear, up-to-date legislation and about the difficulties in predicting policy direction. \n•  Perception challenges. The term 'impact investing' is perceived by local fund managers to imply low returns on investment and is more closely aligned with philanthropy. \n",
      "Key Recommendations": "Interviews revealed the following as promising interventions: \n• Raise awareness of impact investment. Many investors in West Africa either do not know what impact investing is or see it as a new kind of philanthropy—in both cases, the term “impact investment” is not greeted with excitement for those looking to commit money to the region. Raising awareness would help this. This could come in the form of publishing and disseminating more research, developing stronger networks among impact investors to build collective visibility, and outreach by impact investors to commercial investors.  \n• Capitalize on African high net-worth individuals and corporations. Related to the above, it is particularly important to reach out to and engage African HNWIs as new sources of funding. Interviews indicated that there are several African HNWIs looking to direct their wealth to more impactful ends.89 Now is the time to engage them on the potential of impact investing to represent a new wave of African philanthropy that is at once impactful and financially sustainable. At the same time, there are many large corporations emerging in the region that could utilize impact investments to develop their supply chains. Interviewees mentioned that, like HNWIs, such corporations lack awareness and understanding of impact investing. \n• Strengthen the ecosystem of incubators and accelerators. One of the most consistent messages from investors was that it was extremely difficult to find investable enterprises, while one of the most consistent messages from incubators was that they struggled to engage investors. This is peculiar, since incubators provide the very types of business support that would help build a healthy pipeline of investable enterprises for investors. Clearly, there is a gap in collaboration. In order to bridge this gap, two things need to happen: the incubator ecosystem needs to grow and linkages between investors and incubators need to strengthen. \nTo accomplish these goals, impact investors can: \n• Develop relationships with individual incubators to help them understand the types of enterprises they are looking for, the indicators that are most important in deciding whether to invest, and likely future investment pipeline needs. \n• Invest in incubators so that incubator numbers and capacities grow. \n• Work with incubators to build a stronger network of support associations that link investors and investees and engage governments. \n• Educate and engage enterprises on the value of equity through local partnerships. Investors were generally of the opinion that equity investments were more effective at driving enterprise growth than debt, since equity allowed investors to take a more “hands-on” approach and use their expertise to guide the business—often through taking a board seat. However, West African enterprises are hesitant to accept equity investments due to a fear of losing control of their businesses. One of the ways to counteract this is to establish a local presence. interviews indicated that business owners and managers value in-person contact, and are far more likely to trust investors that are both present in and known to their communities. For investors not able to do this, finding local partners or investing indirectly through local fund managers is also a viable option. Those that already have a local presence should, of course, continue to emphasize their role as partners to the enterprises around them. \n• Develop a track record of success through more consistent measurement. It is difficult for investors to align on a common set of metrics and impact indicators, not least because they deal with a variety of different enterprises with different impact profiles. Still, better and more consistent internal measurement, coupled with external reporting, can help to identify drivers of both success and failure, ultimately equipping the industry with a clearer growth path. Greater use of MIS could ease the process of tracking internal metrics and make it easier to publicize results. It is an interesting time for West Africa. A track record of fast economic growth, coupled with the expectation that such growth will continue, has placed it firmly on the agenda of many international and local investors. Impact investors have recently started to turn their attention to the region; though the industry is currently small, there are large opportunities for it to expand. For these opportunities to be realized, however, timely and coordinated effort is needed across the impacting investing industry.\n",

We also find more public-private collaboration in funding than in implementation.\n• The self-assessment scores suggest more progress toward achieving farm-level goals related to production and market access; and less progress toward achieving social (e.g. poverty alleviation) or environmental goals. \n• Extensions tactics and keys to success. Provision of financial services and farm management training appear to substantially advance several goals. ",

      "Key Findings": "President Thein Sein’s administration embarked on a series of generally positive political and economic reforms. Among the most visible signals of the reform agenda has been the raft of legislation passed by Myanmar’s parliament.  Interviews with micro and small businesses and those located outside the biggest cities suggest that economic governance has not changed as significantly for these businesses.  While Myanmar has begun to take steps to rebuild the capacity of government institutions, this process will be lengthy.  Economic data suggest, however, that the private sector is responsible for at least three-quarters of Myanmar’s economic activity.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. Develop, publicize, and consistently implement processes of economic reform drafting, assessment, and implementation. \n\n2. Avoid over-emphasizing and building up expectations about quick economic wins.\n\n3. Increase transparency by making public additional information on taxes, government-granted business licenses, and other dimensions of business regulation.\n\n4. Reform various aspects of the S/R- and local-level business licensing system. \n\n5. Examine and consider reforming excise revenues.",

      "Key Findings": "Several themes emerged during the systematic review of the evaluations. First, social capital, in various forms, was essential to overcoming many constraints. Under the “Improving Resilience of Vulnerable Populations” theme, for example, building social capital was among the most common intervention objectives linked with risk-reduction strategies. Programs that focused on recovery from shocks relied heavily on community participation and trust. Likewise, under “Expanded Markets, Value Chains and Increased Investment,” community-based organizations (CBOs) were key to lifting vulnerable groups out of poverty.",

The analysis also provides an overview of the structure and functions of each value chain, identifies priority end markets and constraints to realizing their benefits, and recommends potential value chain upgrading strategies. The results provide a foundation on which more detailed intervention strategies can be developed.",

In each location the strategy represents the most challenging and long-term component of a wider program to improve sanitation, including improvements to public toilets as an interim measure while the strategy gains traction. Complex tenancy arrangements, limited investment in low-income housing and high population growth only add to the challenges. By seeking to engage all stakeholders involved in this issue, a comprehensive strategy has been created; one which explicitly targets bottom-of-the-pyramid consumers and those most often marginalized in the decision-making process for getting a toilet. Having committed to improved budgetary support to sanitation service delivery, it is envisaged that KMA and GWMA will be positioned in time to implement the strategy with minimal external stakeholder involvement. The ultimate goal is to develop a refined model that could be replicated in other Ghanaian cities and adopted nationally by the Environmental Health and Sanitation Directorate at the ministry level.",

Governance includes regional and national policy, national legal and regulatory frameworks, local governance, and the influence of the different types of capital described in the\nRFSA.\n\nMarine ecosystem health and fisheries resources: Though neither country has a national fisheries management plan, or a transboundary management plan, operationalizing and strengthening fisher organizations to inform management can inform and support future management planning by the respective governments.\n\nSustainable fisheries-based livelihoods: Small-scale fishers lack training, equipment, and basic access to credit, which limits their livelihoods, business growth, and implementation of sustainable fishing practices.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Governance: Transboundary resources management requires both SVG and Grenada to work together to ensure sustainability. This will entail establishing a joint national fisheries committee of informed fisher organizations to outline a way forward, with strengthened capacity to implement actions.\n\nMarine ecosystem health and fisheries resources: data are needed on current fish landing, exports, and fish stock sustainable yield to inform decision-making. Data collection systems that meet Fisheries Division standards should be established for the Grenadines.\n\nSustainable fisheries-based livelihoods: Project training, equipment, labeling, and marketing will further increase post harvest quality standards and available niche markets.",

This study did not analytically investigate the relative return on investment of public-good investments vs. direct investments, nor did it measure the causal impact of the Lab’s investments on development outcomes. That said, the anecdotal evidence that we gathered suggested that USAID's leadership and ability to \"crowd in\" further financial and human resources gives it a particular comparative advantage compared to other development actors.",

This brief explores private models of financing and delivering care, as well as public-private partnerships (PPPs) and joint ventures.   It also presents a range of community-level interventions led by private actors, demonstrating how the private sector can contribute to demand creation, PMTCT and antiretroviral therapy (ART) delivery, and adherence and retention activities.   The discussion includes successes, lessons, and challenges that can inform the efforts of governments, donors, and implementers to adapt or replicate private sector models in new settings.  Effective engagement of private actors is critical to reaching global elimination of mother-to-child HIV transmission (eMTCT) targets and achieving an AIDS-free generation.",

      "Key Recommendations": " USAID should deploy border management and trade experts to southern Africa to identify key interventions and their sequence.\n USAID should facilitate a workshop between key stakeholders in South Africa to understand the practical implications (e.g., ownership of cargo at points along the supply chain) of the new\ncustoms legislation that is expected to enter into force in 2017.\n USAID should host a joint study tour for South African officials and private-sector representatives to consider the experience of other countries, such as Australia, Canada and the U.S., in establishing a BMA.\n USAID should identify potential private-sector associations that it can support through capacity building initiatives, project support, research, training, etc. to advocate more effectively on TF issues at the national and regional levels.\n USAID should work with South African stakeholders to develop a model for an authority for the North-South Corridor.",

Addressing Constraints to Trade in key staples (grain, beans, e.g.) is an important Feed the Future goal that underpins USAID regional mission programs and implicitly many FTF bilateral projects.  As developing country food systems modernize and increasing numbers of urban consumers demand safe, high-quality food, SPS and food safety issues take on greater importance.  A hallmark of FTF’s value chain approach is linking small farmers to markets.  Feed the Future has focused largely on staple food crop value chains in selected ZOIs, but there is increasing investment in diversification through USAID projects and programs in horticulture, livestock (including dairy, poultry), and high-value cash crops such as coffee and cotton.",

      "Document Title": "Private Sector Partnerships: Achieving Enduring Results",
      "Key Findings": "• Market-oriented activities conducted either by partners or by beneficiaries have a higher likelihood of enduring than non-market-oriented partnerships.\n• PPPs designed around a core business opportunity for a profit-driven partner have a high likelihood of creating enduring results.\n• By contrast, partnerships with profit-seeking partners engaging in CSR activities that are not linked to their core business – whether market- oriented or non-market-oriented – are less likely to achieve sustainability. \n• The private sector played a critical role in nine partnerships of the eleven that sustained and scaled.\n• Private sector relationships are most additive as an asset when used to create market linkages.\n• Not surprisingly, of the six instances where the private sector actor could have been any type of actor, our did not sustain.\n• Policy change can be particularly effective when combining private sector assets with government capabilities.\n• Capacity-building produces enduring results only in conjunction with a different pathway to sustainability.\n• Partnerships that achieve policy change demonstrate strong potential to both sustain and scale, without requiring additional funding.\n• Partnerships with corporations that have a strong local presence are more likely to have results that are financially self-sustaining.\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. Intentionally pursue more market-oriented partnerships with\nprivate sector partners. These partnerships should provide critical additionality (ideally through the relationships and/or specialized capabilities of private sector partners) and chart a clear path to sustainability and scale at the outset.\n2. Strengthen USAID practitioners’ and partners’ understanding of expectations for sustainability and scale in USAID’s PPPs.\n3. Modify internal partnership data collection and/or analysis to track sustainability and scale outcomes.\n4. Promote knowledge sharing and peer-to-peer learning on partnership sustainability.\n5. Incorporate key success factors for market-oriented pathways to achieve sustainability and scale.\n6. Ensure continuity of people involved or the transfer of key information in design and especially implementation.\n7. Build checkpoints on sustainability into ongoing partnership processes – and course-correct as needed.\n8. Be intentional about scale during planning and implementation.\n9. Gather insights on implementation by incorporating select metrics into the annual data collection cycle and/or partnership health surveys that are conducted periodically.\n10. Incentivize midterm reporting on progress toward goals for sustainability and scale.\n11. Set expectations for ex-post reporting.\n12. Create incentives for ex-post reporting.\n",

      "Key Findings": "Coastal areas, and those with mangroves in particular, present unique planning challenges, with overlapping resource rights regimes. Given the high value and wide-range of sectoral economic interests, as well as the importance of coastal resources for subsistence livelihoods, multi-sectoral spatial planning provides a powerful tool to identify real or potential conflicts and to support negotiated agreements. Privatization of mangrove areas to individual households or organizations introduces a risk of excluding legitimate users. As a result, co-management governance structures of mangrove forest that integrate diverse user groups provide a potential structure to balance multiple social, ecological and economic objectives in managing this system. The Vietnam pilot demonstrates the appetite of local stakeholders for these structures and their ability to acquire the technical mapping and facilitation skills to develop their own coastal spatial development plans.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. Implementors of participatory coastal mapping activities must engage with authorities at every level.\n2. Based on the above experiences, the pilot recommends engaging with key cross-sectoral stakeholders on coastal spatial planning and mangrove management going forward from local to provincial levels.\n3. Allow new participants to join throughout the process.\n4. Participatory coastal resource planning is most useful in areas where there are complex and competing land use needs.\n5. When seeking the support and engagement of various community\nstakeholders, as well as the private sector, the implementer should have a clear understanding of how the activity will benefit each group and be able to articulate it effectively.",

The Kaleidoscope Model helps fill this void by providing a set of focused and tractable hypotheses to address these dynamics and thereby guide the efforts of those donors, researchers, and national governments concerned with improving the effectiveness of such programs over tim",

This is in part because PPPs are not one practice but several practices with varying contractual and financing models. To better understand the potential scope and impact of these partnerships, clearer definitions, deeper interrogation of the roles of key parties (the government, donors, and the private sector), additional examples, and further research are needed.",

      "Key Findings": "The policies and strategies are not elaborate on the framework to regulate prices and do not specify whose mandate it is to regulate prices of medicines. They have been drawn in a general policy framework of a liberalized, free market economy. However, in principle, where markets fail to result into optimal prices or quantities, the state plays an important role in clearing market failures, as evidenced by the 1929 and 2008 financial crises.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. A national medicine price monitoring system should be instituted throughout the supply chain.\n2. The indicative medicine prices derived from routine surveys should be routinely published and made widely available for the public.\n3. MoH initiative of providing recommended retail prices for medicines should be scaled up to cover a broader range of communicable and non-communicable diseases.",

      "Key Findings": "• Sustainability of democratic processes requires systemic changes and interventions that address all components, elements and stakeholders in the policy cycle.\n\n• Sustainability of change requires systematic oversight of policy and budget making processes, to avoid pro forma processes.\n\n• Citizen participation depends primarily on the awareness and commitment of local politicians to engaging citizens and capacities and the enthusiasm of community leaders.\n\n• A tailor-made, well-designed and expertly implemented local grant scheme can assist the translation of project ideas that tackle specific local concerns or problems into sustainable interventions that have an impact on people’s lives.\n\n• Support provided for strengthening organizational capacities and improving policy-focused advocacy strategy can result in legislative changes in specific issue areas, as has been the case in regulating protection from and prevention of domestic violence and introducing needed services.\n\n•  CSO sustainability and the sustainability of their initiatives show creative ways that local organizations have persevered from social enterprise creation to technical assistance provision.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. Any future program aimed at strengthening democratic processes should target, at the same time, the government, private and civil sectors, in a well-coordinated manner, as well as during all phases and with all stakeholders of the policy cycle.\n\n2. Any future programming should emphasize this role while having realistic expectations of capacities and political context possibilities amongst CSOs and citizens.\n\n3. A key focus of future efforts should be raising the awareness of and building the capacities of Mayors, their teams and members of local councils to embrace and support participatory processes and understand the benefits it brings - on strengthening the knowledge and skills of current leadership.\n\n4. Future efforts should be modeled on the best practices of a local grant scheme that has flexibility and close collaboration with the communities.\n\n5. Any future efforts should consider the extent to which legislative changes are of interest to all sides and can be prioritized in specific issue areas.\n\n6. Any future effort should keep in mind the variety of forms sustainability can take, and support innovative approaches to fostering both organizational and issue sustainability.\n",

There are clear opportunities for government-private sector cooperation.\n\n2.1. On the positive side, BAF’s management approach has encouraged private sector commitments, through its ability to link partners to its network.\n\n2.2. Trust between partners did not emerge as an issue or concern in any of the interviews.\n\n2.3. Although outside the scope of the review, the evaluators still sought to make some preliminary assessments as to what types and levels of effects had been generated by the projects to date.\n\n2.4. Big business in South Africa is currently in a difficult position.",
      "Key Recommendations": " BLSA should engage in awareness raising activities for BAF, especially among government partners. \n BLSA should develop a detailed mission statement, hierarchy of objectives, and strategy for the BAF. \n BAF should consider moving to a more formal selection process, and combine this with efforts to increase awareness (in tandem with clarifying its purpose).\n BLSA should draft a statement or position piece on how BAF fits in within the new BLSA strategy.\n BLSA should make a more conscious effort to engage with the government partner in the conceptualization of projects.

      "Key Findings": "The exercise estimated total health expenditure in Ethiopia in 2013/14 at 49.6 billion Ethiopian Birr, representing 4.73 percent of gross domestic product (GDP). \n\nOver 86 percent of the spending was on recurrent expenditures (delivery of health services, provision of health commodities and supplies, and operationalization of the health system), 10 percent was on capital formation, and 3 percent on training and research. \n\nWhile Ethiopia’s per capita health expenditure on essential health services is very low compared with peer countries and WHO’s recommendation of US$60 (by year 2015), it has grown significantly over the past two decades, from US$4.5 in 1995/96 to of US$28.65 in 2013/14. \n\nThe share of domestic health financing has increased from 50 percent to 64 percent (30 percent from government, 33 percent from households, and 1 percent from private employers and\nothers) in the same period. \n\nThe share of spending by “the rest of the world” (bilateral and multilateral donors, and private philanthropists) has fallen from 50 percent in 2010/11 to 36 percent in 2013/14.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Increase the magnitude and per capita spending on health with emphasis on domestic financing.\n\nExpand financial protection to reduce the financial burden that health spending imposes on households and to increase health service utilization by citizens.\n\nProvide financial protection for the poor and needy segments of the population.\n\nInstitutionalize health accounts and regular generation of evidence for policy decision making.",

      "Document Title": "Agricultural Commercialization in Ethiopia: A Review of Warehouse Receipts in the Maize, Wheat, Sorghum, and Tef Value Chains",
      "Key Findings": "In reviewing the utilization and performance of the current WRS, this study found that Ethiopian smallholders are currently excluded from the benefits of a WRS and WRF by factors such as minimum required lot sizes, illiquid credit supply, debilitating interest rates, lack of (quality) storage infrastructure and financial illiteracy. Private warehouses are not accredited by the exchange to issue WRs and are therefore excluded from the system; public warehouses have been criticized from quality and quantity deterioration; and the Exchange cannot hedge lending against the security of future crop production. If, however, all these systems are included in the same overarching WRS, risk is spread across all actors, transaction costs decline, liquidity increases, and prices become more stable. ",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. Expand the focus of the WRS from exported crops to maize, wheat, tef, and barley.\n2. Conduct a capacity audit of all market actors, followed by a capacity building plan with ongoing training and sensitization at all levels.\n3. Align grade standards for all traded commodities across all sectors, tiers, ACCs.\n4. Create a Storage Investment Plan alongside the ATA's planned National Storage Strategy to first analyze constraints and therefore mobilize investment.\n5. Include all members of all tiers in the WRS management and oversight body/ECEA.\n6. Seek evolution of the national telecommunications provider to include services such as mobile money. ",

Many of these partnerships are between USAID and private sector partners (PSPs) working in agriculture. Most partnerships within agriculture value chains aim to (i) graduate smallholder farmers into the commercial sector, (ii) integrate farmers into value chains, (iii) improve farmer skills and productivity, and (iv) increase farmer access to technologies. Effective private partnerships can, therefore, meaningfully improve development outcomes for smallholder farmers while realizing the business interests of PSPs.",

      "Key Findings": "The PAD Project activities are implementing the Kosovo CDCS for DO2, performing in accordance with expectations and even exceeding targets in some cases.\n\nThe enterprise survey indicates notable differences in workforce growth between the PAD activity beneficiary and comparison groups respectively, which reinforces the view that these activities made a useful contribution to workforce growth in Kosovo.\n\nBoth the Government of Kosovo and SME beneficiaries stated that they benefited from the PAD Projects because of the close partnership in implementing important reforms, and improving\ncompetitiveness of enterprises by introducing new technologies, as well as creating market linkages to increase sales and exports.\n\nWhether through formal or informal mechanisms, PAD Activities to date have coordinated and collaborated with a wide range of stakeholders, whether with USAID implementing partners or with other multilateral or bilateral organizations, thereby avoiding duplication of interventions, although it is possible to find examples of donors working in the same area without cooperation.\n\nThe main PAD Project’s competitiveness and job creation activities, EMPOWER PS and AGRO, were not designed to address challenges with respect to women or minority enterprises or job creation; however, both have cooperated with minor PAD Project activities, namely the Kosovo Cluster Business Support (KCBS) activities specially designed to tackle minority business development in North Kosovo, as well as the DO1 Advancing Kosovo Together (AKT) activities.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Improve linkage between Activity IR and Project Results.\n\nMove away from grants for enterprises.\n\nThe PAD Project faces a significant number of important challenges that USAID should address in future projects.\n\nFuture PAD activities should continue to apply a mix of formal and informal mechanisms for collaboration between USAID activities.\n\nUSAID should consider building a long-term component strategy within the CDCS to support local organizations within minority communities to work in concert with the government and other donor programs.",

      "Key Findings": "There are three main principles to keep in mind when engaging with the private sector:\n1) Engaging the private sector on water security is most effective when presented both as a way to address water-related business risks and as a business opportunity.\n2) Industry sectors that have the largest water footprint (apparel, beverage, mining, etc.) have developed water stewardship plans, and can be useful partners and champions when engaging SMEs, who are often suppliers in their industry sector for efforts around water security.\n3) SMEs are often part of bigger value chains, though not always. A two-pronged – top-down and bottom-up – approach, working with MNCs but also with local industry associations, may be the best way to engage SMEs. For both SMEs and MNCs, it is often important to dialogue with neutral brokers (e.g., consulting firms or NGOs) along with local government officials or water managers on basics of water stress, risk and business opportunities.",

The criteria for selection are current capacity on disability inclusion; university (executive level) commitment to disability inclusion; geography; size; opportunity to influence other institutions; and focus on improving accessibility for usability to enhance sustainability.\n\n4. The assistive technology audit revealed needs for equipment/updated equipment. Interviews also brought up the need for training on assistive technology for students, staff, faculty,\nand E-learning professionals.\n\n5. Data gaps exist on the number of students with disabilities (male and female) enrolled.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. Capacity building for disability data collection in Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) is needed.\n\n2. Support HEIs to develop institutionalized disability frameworks that include (a) a disability policy and (b) a disability support office, with specific processes and procedures for providing disability accommodations to students with disabilities.\n\n3. Support 4-5 public institutions in a comprehensive “whole of institution” approach to improve access to facilities, and services programs for students with physical and sensory disabilities.\n\n4. Support the procurement of assistive technology and training for HEIs.\n\n5. Provide technical assistance to support the GOE (e.g., CAPMAS, National Council for Disability Affairs) and HEIs to collect appropriate statistical and research data.",

      "Key Findings": "1. Using a variety of partnership models and approaches allows for a wider range of collaboration and provides a useful testing ground for tackling the complexity inherent in development.\n\n2. Establishing new partnership platforms means longer start-up time and slower expenditures but can reap rewards down the line.\n\n3. Programs falling under DO3 have been effective in meeting program goals and objectives.\n\n4. There is limited evidence that programs and initiatives classified under DO3 are significantly more scalable or sustainable than traditional USAID programs in creating change for the population at the Bottom of the Pyramid.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. Partnership Approach: shift to a more focused portfolio of partnerships to reduce USAID management burden and deepen impact.\n\n2. Create intentional opportunities for greater knowledge sharing, virtual, and in-person networking among DO3 implementing partners, and between DO3 platforms and more traditional programs.\n\n3. Both the IPP and the MA are valid mechanisms to test innovative partnership and intervention models and should be continued in future CDCS.",

      "Key Findings": "Overall, SYLI helped shift community attitudes around the value of education and civic engagement and built Federal and FMSs’ ministry of education capacity in the secondary education sector. The program also created strong partnerships with in-country stakeholders, leading to sustainable institutions and infrastructure that will continue to support secondary school attendance, equitable education and civic engagement.",
      "Key Recommendations": "● A thought leadership and research agenda should be created and agreed upon within 6 months of program start up instead of creating the plan midway into the program.\n● Programs of this size should have a Consortium Coordinator position to help manage all key stakeholders, and to bring together all key stakeholders (i.e. IPs, donor, ministries) to reaffirm the way forward whenever there are significant changes (i.e. annual plans, key personnel, new partners, cost modification).\n● There is a need for a multi-stakeholder forum where the UN is also involved in program activities to build consensus.\n● Programming should be more holistic, including both education/training and economic activities.

      "Key Recommendations": "Discuss discrepancies in total market data with all stakeholders and achieve consensus on the total condom market for each sector (public, social marketing, and NGO).\n\nInitiate dialogue with MOH and better coordination among donors to develop specific procurement milestones for MOH for male and female condoms and clarity around donor investment timelines.\n\nCollect more detailed information from social marketing organizations on sales, positioning, geographic coverage, price, and cost-recovery levels for market segmentation analysis.\n\nUse OpenLMIS system to conduct a district-by-district analysis of public sector condom distribution, including frequency of reported stockouts.\n\nUse LMIS data to conduct an analysis of the frequency of condom stockouts by district.\n\nImplement systems to improve requisition and reporting systems for CBOs and NGOs working at the community level.",

      "Key Recommendations": "The Government of Sierra Leone through the Ministry of Health and Sanitation, represented by the District Health Management Team (DHMT) and other related community structures should continue\nsensitizing and monitoring on-going programs on nutrition and hygiene with other implementing partners.\n\nThe Government of Sierra Leone, through the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Food Security (MAFFS) should\nundertake regular sensitizations on the benefits of backyard gardening and the importance of eating diverse foods to help improve their nutritional status rather than selling them.\n\nThe Government should work on community market access roads to increase market access to target communities.\n\nIn the future, some part capacity assessment should be done before relying on national partners to undertake certain technical aspects of the intervention.\n\nThe Government should support the local banks and telecommunication companies to increase outreach services to the rural poor.",

      "Key Recommendations": "1. Recognize a role for the private sector in HIV service delivery—the private sector won’t introduce services unless it sees a\nmarket opportunity, such as high demand or low barriers to entry.\n\n2. Leverage the private sector’s diversity to provide differentiated care across the HIV clinical cascade to clients of all income tiers.\n\n3. Determine how to pay the private sector.\n\n4.

      "Key Recommendations": "1. Establish government partnerships to drive policy level and broader ecosystem changes in WatSan.\n\n2. Seek sustainable strategies for building capacity at the ULB level.\n\n3. Coordinate and integrate with other development partners on programming for longer term outcomes.\n\n4.

Further root-cause analysis at the RRHs can help identify possible reasons for the low scores.\n• Provide further technical assistance to the RRHs so that strategic plans can map out improvement plans for poor performance in other functional areas, such as stock management and LMIS record keeping.\n• Ensure JMS has a multiyear operational plan that ties in its partnerships and strategic goals so that the operations contribute to those strategic goals.",

      "Key Findings": "The BalanceD-MERL consortium found that the technical assistance pilot with Women + Water provided limited evidence to support its hypotheses about the benefits of integrating MERL activities with program design and about application of the four BalanceD-MERL principles. \n\nThe findings are limited because, as of September 2018, the program and MERL implementation activities on Women + Water are in their beginning stages. \n\nHowever, early feedback from the partners about the implementation of the MERL strategy are suggestive that integration is ongoing, and there is evidence of adaptive management.",
      "Key Recommendations": "To enable integration of MERL with program design, example action items include (1) requesting program staff to work with the MERL team to co-develop the theory of change as well as the subsequent MERL activities and (2) building in sufficient time for the co-\ndevelopment of MERL activities in the program design phase.\n\nTo leverage the MERL competency of leadership and program\nstaff, example action items include (1) assessing their MERL competency and developing solutions for competency gaps and (2) identifying MERL champions who can advocate for investment in MERL competency and the use of MERL for good program management.\n\nTo give equal important to learning activities, example action items include (1) establishing a learning culture by encouraging program staff to share information transparently and (2) thoughtfully designing learning activities during the program design phase.",

      "Key Recommendations": "Future USAID/Ghana WASH interventions should assess and incorporate relevant best safe-water storage practices and BCC components into their interventions to ensure that supplied water remains safe at the point of use.\n\nUSAID should consider how it can continue to support newly established organizations such as the WSCs over the medium term. \n\nUSAID should ensure that future WASH activities engage with key government and institutional stakeholders as partners to foster sustainability after the activity ends.",

",
      "Key Recommendations": "USAID’s leadership in FP and systems strengthening should\ncontinue.\n\nThere is a need to sustain efforts to reach youth and adolescents with high-quality FP information and services.\n\nIPs should be encouraged to continue to disseminate learning and evidence, both the good and bad (we learn as much from failures as successes), in the spirit of building stronger FP service delivery platforms, national FP programs, and a global CoP.\n\nThe evaluators respect organizational differences in QA as an FP service delivery investment, but believe there should be minimum standards that transcend organizations.\n\nThere is room to improve on organizational models and processes for capacity transfer.",

Research by Deloitte and others shows that across the world, private enterprise is finding more and more ways of profitably serving the poor. \nEngaging the power of private enterprise in development – supporting responsible spending of Agency resources for sustainable outcomes – is becoming an essential capability for development agencies.",

      "Key Findings": "Amidst dynamic systemic change, uncertainty and complex risks, in order to achieve development and wellbeing outcomes, communities, governance structures, implementing and thought partners must engage in integrating a resilience approach to applying CEDRR in humanitarian and development programs.\n\nThis approach to promoting climate and environmental sensitivity, risk reduction and resilience capacity-building must be applied equally to operations, staffing, partnership, as a precursor enabling environment. \n\nThis approach supports adaptive program design,\nimplementation, monitoring and evaluation amidst shocks and stresses impacting the communities we work with and the way we are able to work with them. \n\nThis action brief has offered a new Framework (Fig. 1), three CEDRR case studies and example best practices for applying CEDRR (Table 1) to inform and shift how we design and adaptively manage development and humanitarian programs and policies. \n\nThis process cultivates the tenets necessary for integration of CEDRR to build resilience and improve development gains over time and scales.",

      "Key Recommendations": "The future of innovation in Georgia depends on its ability to integrate into global value chains.\n\nSucceeding in this effort requires building on Georgia’s differentiated assets, ranging from its free trade agreements, to low cost labor and energy, to low levels of corruption.\n\nWhile Georgians have an innate capability to innovate, cultivating this capability from the ground up will take generations and is most likely to keep the country in a perpetual state of “catch-up”.",

      "Document Title": "DO 2 Gender Analysis Feed the Future Bangladesh",
      "Key Findings": "The gender analysis revealed that USAID implementing partners (IPs) and other stakeholders in Bangladesh are grappling with how to best engage women under a private sector-driven approach.\nDifferent strategies are being applied, some of which show promise. Certain actors are targeting women through traditional value chains (VCs) and roles, while others are looking for new opportunities. Long- term sensitization programs around shared decision-making and control over assets have made a household approach viable, while supporting strong female entrepreneurs is helping women access larger and nontraditional sectors.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Gender mainstreaming in the DO 2 portfolio: IPs should remain open to a variety of potential pathways to achieve women’s\neconomic empowerment that are designed around gender-sensitive analyses carried out during the start-up phase, and that are regularly updated to capture and respond to any changes that take place as a result of activity interventions or other external factors.\n\nEnabling environment: IPs can work through local stakeholders to raise awareness of and access to any government subsidies and other benefits targeted at female farmers/entrepreneurs.\n\nValue chain roles: To enable female producers to learn good agricultural practices and access inputs and information, IPs should continue to apply the local service provider (LSP) model.\n\nAccess to resources and opportunities: IPs can continue to engage with financial service providers – both microfinance institutions and commercial banks that are committed to working with women- to\ndesign and promote gender-sensitive financial products.\n\nEffective monitoring: Investing in monitoring, evaluation, and learning at the IP level is critical, both to improve internal practices and to understand how to motivate the private sector to expand its role in women’s empowerment.",

      "Key Recommendations": "With one year to go, several urgently important actions must be taken to maximize YP contribution toward increasing employment and income among youth in Ethiopia. In order to have an increased\ncontribution toward that, there is a need to strengthen coaching and mentoring of youth, involvement of parents and guardians improve access to financial and marketing opportunities, and place more emphasis on the building of skills and access to employment opportunities for female youth.",

      "Key Findings": "Through the team’s research, the rural sector of Southern Bangladesh is revealed to be a crowded mosaic of tiny plots of land that barely support the livelihoods of myriad hardworking farming households.\n\nProducers seemingly operate independently, not to say alone, buying and selling as individual units, despite potential for lower input prices and higher output prices of purchases and sales made in bulk. \n\nThe organization of farmers into groups for business purposes was not found to be a common practice, nor was it a standard component of IPs’ implementation strategies, contrary to international best practice in rural development circles.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. Strengthen focus on GAP and build alliances with the district-level DAEs to disseminate GAP principles as widely as possible, using male and female field agents to spread the technology and train producers in its application.\n2. Project-driven interventions should remain as an optional intervention modality to enhance desired impact on the economic empowerment of women in the targeted MS. \n3. Make women empowerment a targeted and specifically monitorable outcome through tailored\nand effective project-driven interventions. \n4. To ensure full application of the MS approach (i.e., with due attention to support functions and the role of government and women farmer organizations), work closely and holistically with one “Bibhag” or divisional administration to strengthen support functions of one promising MS with high women IGA potential. \n5. Explore concrete options to set up capital loan bank guarantee services to female-headed agribusinesses at experienced commercial banks that actively support rural sector enterprise.\n6. Market the IP projects to the selected banks as the quality assurance provider of MS development activities – being less experienced in agriculture, they will need that reassurance to fully engage with beneficiaries.",

      "Key Findings": "Overall, project targets were ambitious, and the project did not meet them.\n\nInter-agency coordination and collaboration with government structures is essential to ensure close linkage and limit potential for\nduplication and working at crossed purposes.\n\nClear exit plan from the beginning would have improved buy-in and assignment of institutional responsibilities and capacity building\n– to foster shared ownership from the start.",
      "Key Recommendations": "The Karamoja context presents an extremely complex and challenging context for donor-funded aid interventions and must be fully understood if development interventions are to be successful.\n\nA close working relationship with both government and traditional structures is essential to ensure coordination, uptake of improved practices and behaviors, and long-term sustainability.\n\nTo gain greater insight and learning from implemented strategies, approaches, and activities, projects should ensure that monitoring, evaluation, and learning systems across the life of the project can characterize households to understand which types of households participated in which activities, and how different household types (e.g., based on project participation and relative wealth and food security status) benefitted in term of adoption, outcomes, and impacts.",

Incorporate activities that strengthen GBV awareness, prevention and reporting throughout the value chain\n3. Strengthen women’s leadership and organization within the WMR value chain.\n4. Improve gender equity in access to recyclables for informal male and female waste-pickers and collectors.\n5. Increase women’s access to, understanding and application of market information",

      "Key Recommendations": "1. Geographically align future food security and biodiversity-funded NRM programs such that technical assistance in the appropriate livelihoods will be integrated with land use and resource management planning as part of an NRM program.\n\n2. Support research in promoting viable energy alternatives that will be less damaging to biodiversity than existing options and exploring renewable energy feed-in tariff or energy subsidy programs that could improve non-biomass energy use in urban areas.\n\n3. Introduce dedicated programming focused on conservation of biodiversity and tropical forests in coastal landscapes, targeting the Coastal Forests of Eastern Africa Biodiversity Hotspot and marine ecosystems.\n\n4. Continue working with relevant GoT agencies, other donors, and IPs to support CWT initiatives through capacity building and training for law enforcement, rangers, and village game scouts.\n\n5. Introduce integrated family planning programming in high population growth areas that also have high biodiversity value.",

To do\nthis, the GOI needs to establish a strong national and provincial team responsible for health policy development and quality assurance, located at the Ministry of Health (MOH) and assigned the following tasks:\n• Develop policy briefs based on promising approaches, including those from the USAID MNH portfolio lessons learned review, to be disseminated to relevant policymakers and key stakeholders.\n• Reform health policies to better address and strengthen critical aspects of health system programs, including quality of care, local governance, the Eastern Indonesia health system, private sector engagement, and use of data for decision-making.\n• Develop national- and provincial-level strategies with clear instructions and guidelines for health policy and program implementation.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Improving quality of care through an online referral system, mentoring of all health facilities, accreditation of health facilities, audits of maternal and neonatal deaths, and ANC for early detection and management of eclampsia/pre-eclampsia.\n\nReliance on local governance for community engagement for managing basic health care services, integrated health program planning, and evidence-based health advocacy at the local level.\n\nOther recommendations include strengthening the health system in eastern Indonesia, private sector engagement, using data for decision-making, and sustaining and scaling up promising approaches.

      "Key Findings": "Private Equity (PE) funds faced key prudential roadblocks in the cost-effective investment and repatriation of their funds. Conventionally, PE funds provide equity financing to target companies; however, in case of debt financing instruments, PE management companies registered abroad are constrained by rigid caps on the debt charges that can be applied to companies receiving debt financing.\n\nSECP, the main regulatory institution for eWRS, was essential to\nexpediting the Collateral Management Companies (CMC) Regulations (May 2017), which successfully encouraged eWRS pilots in wheat, paddy, and maize.\n\nThe respective GoP agencies lacked the capacity to implement the AML supervisory manual. FMD formulated the strategy so that the supervisory manual could be implemented as early as possible.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Follow-on programming is recommended to ensure that domestic PE funds are permitted to raise capital from pension funds and provident funds; and foreign PE funds will be allowed to invest in domestic securities.\n\nTwo steps are necessary for a rapid launch of the eWHR regime:\n1. SECP issues the first CMC license; and\n2. SBP includes eWHRs as collateral in its prudential regulations.\n\nIn order to ameliorate the above constraints, we recommend that the Finance and Project Management departments of each government should form a joint \"data\" office that would take ownership for loan and project data. This would greatly help the government to streamline the process of analyzing the debt portfolio.",

      "Key Findings": "According to the article, programs implemented by public-private partnerships hold the promise of greater, longer-lasting social impact than programs operated by stakeholders working independently. There is no one-size-fits-all approach to partnership; what works best with one particular program, corporate culture, or partnership venture may not work at all in a different situation.\n\nLeaders of non-profits are in a position to assume a unique role in brokering and maintaining partnerships within the private sector, and in integrating the private sector contribution with that of governmental partners.This facilitating role is a demanding one and, to be effective, must be actively embraced by non-profit leadership. Lastly, non-profit leaders willing to take on the challenge must ensure, through their facilitating function, the presence of the fundamental factors critical for the success of the partnership.",
      "Key Recommendations": "We believe that leaders of non-profit organizations are in a unique position to communicate across sectors and skillfully facilitate the partnership process. Non-profit leaders willing to take on the challenge must ensure, through their facilitating function, the presence of the fundamental factors critical for the success of the partnership: committed leadership, common interests, and clear accountability for results.\n\nWhile the public-private partnership will not guarantee the success of development programs, the combined expertise and resources of governmental organizations, teamed with those of commercial and non-profit private sector entities, offer the promise of more creative, effective, and sustainable interventions to achieve humanitarian and development objectives worldwide.",

      "Key Findings": "Innovation in the service of development goals is not just about achieving technological breakthroughs. Recent research shows that new business models often matter far more than the technology of a given product when serving poor communities. Moreover, promising technologies do not bring about improvements in the lives of the world’s poorest people unless they are adequately invested in, rigorously evaluated, and then brought to scale, which typically requires the collaboration of many actors, including the private and philanthropic sectors and government. The following policy briefs explore these issues in detail, lay out the challenges, and offer a range of specific recommendations on what needs to happen and why.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. Overcoming the weaknesses subsidized and for-profit models requires partnerships between nonprofit and profit actors through the creation of hybrid models. Hybrid models would combine the development efforts of a government, donor, foundation and/or INGO with that of a private corporation under a joint venture, which builds on the financial and accountability strengths of the nonprofit sector and the management, implementation and innovation strengths of the private sector. \n2. Financial products should integrate strategies to overcome barriers related to illiteracy. There are typically higher levels of illiteracy in rural areas and financial literacy may be low, both of which can inhibit effective adoption of services. \n3. For bank-led models, it may be wise to team with an MNO for rural development or look at more human-centered solutions where transaction data may not be real time, but regularly synched as the network allows. \n4.  Central to the green growth strategy is technological innovation\nand the establishment of creative, integrated, private and public sector approaches to support innovation in developing countries.\n5. A first, necessary condition for donors to begin to engage meaningfully with private firms, whether smaller impact enterprises or large MNCs, is the creation of independent, arm’s-length intermediaries with the expertise, independence and investment outlook to be able to take on such tasks, and to do so at the scale required to address the problems at hand. \n6. U.S. Leadership: Roles for the Public Sector\n   1) Measure Cost-Effectiveness and Set Clear Targets;\n   2) Set Aside Funding for Evaluation and Learn from Failure;\n   3) Create Multidonor Special Intermediary to Seed and Scale Up \n       Innovative Private Sector Solutions.",

      "Key Findings": "The purpose of this paper is to analyze and develop policy recommendations implementation sources of development funding that come from the PPP in West Java in an effort to improve the optimization of the utilization of these funds. The method used was qualitative research with emphasis on four main aspects, namely: institutional analysis and the stakeholders involved, regulation and policy analysis, implementation and analysis of the shape and pattern analysis of sources of funding. This research shows that in terms of funding, the banking institutions are still major stakeholders in the financing of PPP implementation in West Java, Indonesia that has experienced improvement in the regulation of the sector by the government. However, there are still obstacles in the implementation of PPP and limited alternative sources of financing of PPP in in West Java Indonesia. To optimize the sources of development in funding primarily coming from the PPP scheme in achieving development goals in West Java Indonesia can be done by collaborated of stakeholder. ",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. For Institutional Aspects, to strengthen institutional PPP, the role of\nlocal governments must be expanded in the implementation of the PPP the concept and establishment must been hanced in an effort to facilitate and monitor PPP projects.\n2. For Aspects of Policy and Regulation, there is the need to clarify the authority of the central government in the implementation of PPP, to develop policies to strengthen the PPP activity planning, as well as the preparation of the national medium term development plan that states clearly the role of government and the private sector in development funding.\n3. For Implementation Aspects, the preparation of PPP can be strengthened through improvement of PPP executive capacity and widen the development of PPP implementation; it also needs to strengthen the role of government in the implementation of PPP by clearly defining the government to guarantee the planning of an activity that is in harmony with the PPP timeframe development planning.\n4. Aspects of Funding Sources and Patterns mean government policies are needed to bridge the short term or medium and long term funding needed to optimize the mobilization of the source of banking funds. The government should issue a policy that can provide convenience in using resources from the non-banking sector.  \n5. To optimize the sources of development in funding primarily coming\nfrom the PPP scheme in achieving development goals in West Java Indonesia can be done by collaborated of stakeholder. \n",

      "Key Recommendations": "Understanding the business sector: corporations would like USAID staff to better understand the role of the business sector in advancing development and as a partner to USAID.  Deepening strategic relationships: corporations want a more strategic relationship in which USAID treats them as real partners on more equal footing.  Fostering transparency: it is common for those outside a large bureaucracy like USAID to view it as a “black box” and to have difficulty knowing where and how to engage it.  Expanding convening: Corporate officials see USAID’s biggest strength as convening and creating alliances at the international, national, and subnational levels, with both public and private institutions.`",

      "Key Findings": "In place of a government-driven focus on crop production targets, the paper offers a concrete and systematic strategy for how Myanmar can modernize its agricultural and food sector. The strategy embraces market-oriented, private sector-led investment, innovation, and dynamism that is centered on small farmers throughout the country. It requires forward-looking and efficient government policies and institutional support with greater interaction among key stakeholders characterized by full transparency and accountability.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. Provide farmers with the freedom to choose which agricultural products to grow that will provide the best opportunity for them to increase their incomes relative to their land and labor assets, a policy to be embedded in appropriate ministerial statements, laws, and regulations.\n\n2. Provide farmers with greater land tenure security over agricultural lands.\n\n3. Invest in supply chain infrastructure – transport and logistics, wholesale markets, electricity, and Internet, as well as research, extension, skill-building, and security – along all spatial segments of the agricultural and food sector.",

      "Key Findings": "The investments government and businesses make in basic and applied research and development (R&D) plant the seeds for the technologies, products, firms, and industries of tomorrow. They contribute substantially to the fact that at least one-half of America’s economic growth can be attributed to scientific and technological innovation. But the increased complexity of technological innovation as well as the growing strength of America’s economic competitors mean that it’s no longer enough to simply fund scientific and engineering research and hope it gets translated into commercial results. The U.S. government needs to expand federal support for research and, just as important, it needs to improve the efficiency of the process by which federally funded knowledge creation leads to U.S. innovation and jobs.",
      "Key Recommendations": "To stimulate private sector innovation, the incoming administration should work with Congress on the following policies.\n1. Implement innovation vouchers.\n2. Incentivize “megafunds” around high-risk research and development.\n3. Increase R&D tax credit generosity.\n4. Ensure that small and medium-sized enterprises are familiar with available R&D tax credits.\n5. Implement an innovation box to spur enterprises’ efforts to\ncommercialize technologies.\n6. Revise the tax code to support innovation by research-intensive, pre-revenue companies.",

      "Document Title": "Criteria for Risk Allocation in Public-Private Partnerships: A Comparative Analysis Of Three Energy from Waste Projects ",
      "Key Findings": "All three cases analyzed in this study reveal that:  \n \n•\tConsistent with other findings in the academic literature, the ability to manage risk is the unique criterion adopted in practice both between public and private parties and within the SPV. In fact, SPVs have passed on as many as possible of the risks for which they agreed to become contractually liable.\n•\tAlthough not recognized by that literature, the case studies suggest the bearing of default risks remains with the public partner whatever the contractual arrangements with the private partner.\n•\tAlthough the private partners recognize that the bearing of risk is not coincident with the management of risk, the public sector partners seem oblivious of this fact and so fail to understand the importance of this issue.\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "•\tThe case studies make clear that justification of use of PPPs is predominantly based on the avoidance of the delays in construction and commissioning of service infrastructures associated with conventional procurement. This justification is however at best partial by default and at worst deliberately highly selective in its portrayal and treatment of risk. This is not to say there are no risk management benefits to be derived from PPPs but, instead, suggests that the risk management rationale for PPPs has been overstated and the need for robust risk governance mechanisms neglected accordingly.  \n•\tThe case studies make clear also that contractual rigidity is in sharp contrast with the dynamism of context, suggesting that further work on governance aspects is required, especially those that can be important in managing contractual incompleteness over time. \n•\tThe case studies‟ results make clear that these governance issues must be addressed irrespective of the particular form and structure of PPPs in EfW schemes and irrespective of their context and host country. Hence, further work should extend the analytical framework adopted in this study by considering governance aspects to deal with contractual incompleteness and how it should be governed in a dynamic (rather than static) interactive business context. This more holistic approach is required to underpin value for money.\n\n",

      "Key Findings": "In the first 36 months, 1328 patients with TB were registered in the public-private partnership. Treatment success rates were >90%, and <1% of patients defaulted. Case notification of sputum-positive patients in the study area increased from 54 per 100 000 to 102 per 100 000. The numbers of patients with TB started on treatment by private practitioners decreased by more than two-thirds, the number of private pharmacies that stocked anti-TB drugs by one-third, the number of pharmacies selling anti-TB drugs by almost two-thirds, and sales of anti-TB drugs in pharmacies by almost two-thirds. Private practitioners were happy to refer patients to the public-private partnership. Not all private practitioners had to be involved: many patients bypassed private practitioners and went directly to free DOTS centres.\nA combination of the strengths of private practitioners, nongovernmental organizations, and the public sector in a public private partnership can be used to provide a service that is liked by patients and gives high rates of treatment success and increased rates of patient notification. Similar public-private partnerships are likely to be replicable elsewhere, as inputs are not large and no special requirements exist.",

      "Key Findings": "In this article, we have emphasized the importance of complementing discussions of the efficiency effects of private sector influence and the normative issues in which the critics engage, with a focus on power, legitimacy, and authority in the multilateral system. It is then not selfevident that increased private sector participation necessarily leads to a weakening of the multilateral institutions. It may also strengthen the role of the institutions as actors in the global system. In particular, this is likely to be the case for multilateral institutions that are able to assume the role of nodal points in complex networks of governance emerging from the multitude of private-public partnerships now being developed. Increased private sector participation may indeed be a strategy by default, as it was developed against the background of insufficient funding from member states. But at the same time, it should be seen as a deliberate—and perhaps successful—attempt by the multilateral institutions to regain relevance precisely by placing them at center stage in a new structure of world governance based on public private partnerships organized along the lines of overlapping networks of governance.

      "Key Findings": "Within the last four years, a number of high profile reports outlining new strategies for pulling African agriculture out of its current impasse have emerged. These include the Comprehensive African Agriculture Development Programme of NEPAD, and the InterAcademy Council Report commissioned by UN Secretary General Koffi Annan. Whilst these strategies are a welcome improvement on those that have characterised African agriculture in the past, it is argued here that like their predecessors, they fail to focus on business-competitive approaches as an integral part of the reform package needed to stimulate African agricultural productivity and development. This paper draws on innovation, business and organisation literature to highlight some of these approaches. It focuses on three concepts: value innovation, lead user focus and organisational value logic.",

Local health needs, including diseases that predominantly affect the poor, have driven much of this success. We argue that emerging domestic firms can play an important role as reliable and high-quality suppliers of existing products and as innovators for global health needs. Indeed, these firms’ participation may make existing global health approaches more sustainable. However, global health stakeholders, including international donors and the Indian and Chinese governments, will need to fashion incentives for these companies to retain a strategic focus on the global poor.\n",

      "Key Findings": "This paper evaluates the growing presence of China’s private business sector in Africa. Currently, attention focuses on China’s state-owned enterprises in extractive industries. Less attention is paid to Chinese private enterprises. This study fills a knowledge-gap by evaluating characteristics and motivations of Chinese private firms in Africa, and assesses their development impacts. Key findings are that the Chinese private firms have followed their own paths to Africa, and the primary factors driving private investment are African market opportunities, competition within China and the presence of a strong entrepreneurial spirit. An effective mechanism bridging a gap between China’s African Policy and its implementation in terms of private sector engagement is lacking. To maximise development gains, a top-down and bottom-up ‘two-way street’ approach to Chinese public–private sector relations is necessary. This is a mutual learning process for the Chinese public and private sectors and also China–Africa relations. These are fluid relationships with each adapting to and shaping the other.",

      "Document Title": "Business to the rescue: private sector actors and global environmental regimes’ legitimacy",
      "Key Findings": "In 2006, Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) adopted decision VIII/17 to further involve the private sector in the activities of the Convention. This initiative mainly aims at improving the current regime’s legitimacy. By increasing business involvement, decision VIII/17 can be viewed within the context of the current academic debate on the ‘privatisation’ of environmental governance, which refers to the growing importance of private actors in the formulation of environmental policies. Against this background, this article aims at: (1) assessing the extent to which decision VIII/17 might reverse the CBD’s legitimacy crisis and (2) analysing the issues at stake when private sector actors are involved in environmental regimes. In order to do so, the article analyses the consequences of decision VIII/17 in terms of internal representation and transparency—and external—institutional efficiency and implementation—legitimacy.",
      "Key Recommendations": "The preceding analysis enables us to draw some practical recommendations on the legitimacy of the CBD. The further involvement of private sector actors can potentially play an important role in filling two of legitimacy’s deficits in the current biodiversity regime: the representativeness of its decision-making as well as the implementation of its principles. It is a positive step towards the inclusion of actors that have been mainly indifferent or obstructive so far. Moreover, the diversity of business skills and positions, when mobilised constructively, could represent a rich tool towards more biodiversity preservation.",

The partnerships allocate resources to projects that are socially desirable from an international perspective, yet without the global partnerships will not be performed. Cost-benefit analysis can identify and compare the social and the private costs and benefits of the projects, thereby identifying cases where global public-private partnerships will provide socially desirable results when markets alone will not. Cost-benefit analysis can assess the necessity and the sufficiency of strategies proposed by the partnerships. The paper discusses modifications to cost-benefit analysis required for its use in evaluations of the global public-private partnerships, explaining the need for market-centered valuations, but also explaining the role of alternative social valuations.",

      "Key Findings": "This study examines the role of public–private partnerships (PPPs) in promoting pro-poor productivity-enhancing technological innovation in the international agricultural research system. The study examines the extent to which PPPs are being used to overcome market and institutional failures that otherwise inhibit the development and dissemination of technologies targeted speciﬁcally to small-scale, resource-poor farmers in developing countries. Drawing on a survey of 75 PPP projects in the international system, ﬁndings suggest that while PPPs are changing the way the system manages its research agenda, few partnerships lead to joint innovation processes with the private sector. This indicates the need for closer examination of organizational practices, cultures, and incentives in the international agricultural research system.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Speciﬁc recommendations include the need for the following:\n1) platforms on which to assemble relevant partners, identify incentive compatibility, agree on mutual objectives, and assign roles and responsibilities appropriately\n(2) resources commitments from all partners not only to a project’s research activities, but also to the coordination activities needed to manage and sustain partners’ commitment\n(3) organizational mechanisms to facilitate the exchange of knowledge and resolve conﬂicts arising from the process, \n(4) benchmarks and decision-points that allow partners to evaluate progress, revise the course of a project, and terminate the project as necessary\n(5) strategies to manage and mitigate the risks associated with projects, including both formal legal and ﬁnancial strategies and informal strategies that emphasize external communications and political support.\n",

      "Key Findings": "In this article, the authors define and analyze the legal framework for publicprivate partnerships (PPP) as a new institution under Slovenian law. In the first part of the article, the authors discuss the legal definition of PPP in the European Union. In the authors’ opinion, the EU’s concept of PPP can be defined and regulated in several ways. As a result, the understanding of PPP differs from one member state to another. A related issue is the question of the definition of ‘public service’. Before defining and discussing new forms of PPP as determined in the 2006 Slovenian Law on PPP, the authors discuss the economic rationale for implementing the two types of PPP in Slovenia: special contractually based partnerships and corporate-based partnerships. The former can be a concession agreement or public-procurement agreement, while the latter is a type of newly established or newly transformed legal entity. In the next part of the article, the authors describe new legal procedures governing PPP arrangements in the future and and offer some limited empirical evidence on those concession agreements that already exist in Slovenia. The authors conclude the article with some open questions about the legal regulation of PPP in the Slovenian legal system as well as an international comparison.",

      "Document Title": "Public-Private Partnerships in Hong Kong: Good Governance - The Essential Missing Ingredient?",
      "Key Findings": "In recent years the potential of the Public-Private Partnership (PPP) model in securing sustainable development has been emphasised by various international organisations including the United Nations(UN) and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). These bodies, however, have warned that for PPPs to fulfill their potential as development tools, then both a favourable business environment and key aspects of ‘good governance’ need to be in place and functioning. This article examines PPP policies and projects in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China (HKSAR) over recent years. Ranked by several key agencies as having the freest economy in the world, Hong Kong might appear to be a particularly promising location for using PPPs to attain economic and social infrastructure development goals. Surprisingly, however, many potential PPP projects there frequently fail to reach fruition. Asking why this should be so, the article argues that the lack of certain critical ingredients of ‘good governance’ in Hong Kong has had a direct and negative impact on the fulfillment of its PPP potential. Of particular concern is government’s frequent disregard of public views and the exclusion of the public from early and meaningful participation. This reflects an approach that can perhaps best be described as reliance on ‘Government-Private’ rather than on ‘Public-Private’ Partnerships.",
      "Key Recommendations": "In addition to facilitating appropriate and timely stakeholder and public participation, and while recognising that good governance is never going to be an easy concept either to define or to implement, the UNECE suggests five other principles to follow. These are, essentially: 1) Decency in forming and implementing rules without harming or causing grievance to people; 2) Transparency in making decisions; 3) Accountability with political actors responsible to society for what they say and do; 4)Fairness in applying rules equally to everyone in society; and 5) Efficiency in applying limited human and financial resources without waste, delay or corruption or without prejudicing future generations.

      "Key Findings": "Various promising claims have been made that business can help alleviate poverty, and can do so in ways that add value to the bottom line. This article begins by highlighting that the evidence for such claims is not especially strong, particularly if business is thought of as a development agent, i.e. an organization that consciously and with accountability contributes towards pro-poor outcomes. It goes on to ask whether, if we did know more about either the business case or the poverty alleviation case, would this give cause for greater optimism that business could make a significant contribution to development. By exploring the experiences of producers of Fairtrade tea in Kenya, we reveal the complex nature of what constitutes a beneficial outcome for the poor and marginalized, and the gap that can exist between ethical intentions and the experience of their intended beneficiaries. The lessons of these experiences are relevant for Fairtrade and any commercial initiative that seeks to achieve outcomes beneficial and recognizable to the poor, and raise questions about the integration of social and instrumental outcomes that a future generation of ethical entrepreneurship will need to address.",

      "Key Findings": "International organizations (IO) have been widely criticized as ineffective. Yet scholars and practitioners assessing IO performance frequently focus on traditional modes of governance such as treaties and inter-state dispute-resolution mechanisms. When they observe poor performance, moreover, they often prescribe a strengthening of those same activities. We call this reliance on traditional state-based mechanisms International Old Governance (IOG). A better way to understand and improve IO performance is to consider the full range of ways in which IOs can and do operate - including, increasingly, by reaching out to private actors and institutions, collaborating with them, and supporting and shaping their activities. Such actions are helping to develop an intricate global network of public, private and mixed institutions and norms, partially orchestrated by IOs, that we call Transnational New Governance (TNG). With proper orchestration by IOs, TNG can ameliorate both state failure - the inadequacies of IOG - and market failure - the problems that result when the creation and evolution of norm-setting institutions is highly decentralized. Orchestration thus provides a significant way for IOs to improve their regulatory performance. Some IOs already engage actively with private actors and institutions - we provide a range of illustrations, highlighting the activities of the UN Environment Programme (UNEP). Yet there remains a significant orchestration deficit that provides real opportunities for IOs. We draw on the lessons of existing IO activities to suggest additional possibilities for improving IO performance.",

      "Key Findings": "International organizations (IOs) have been widely criticized as ineffective. Yet scholarsandpractitionersassessingIOperformancefrequentlyfocusontraditionalmodes of governance such as treaties and inter-state dispute-resolution mechanisms. When they observe poor performance, moreover, they often prescribe a strengthening of those same activities. We call this reliance on traditional state-based mechanisms “International Old Governance” (IOG). A better way to understand and improve IO performance is to consider the full range of ways in which IOs can and do operate—including, increasingly, by reaching out to private actors and institutions, collaborating with them, and supporting and shaping their activities. Such actions are helping to develop an intricate global network of public, private, and mixed institutions and norms, partially orchestrated by IOs, that we call “Transnational New Governance” (TNG). With proper orchestration by IOs, TNG can ameliorate both “state failure”—the inadequacies of IOG—and “market failure”—the problems that result when the creation and evolution of norm-setting institutions is highly decentralized. Orchestration thus provides a significant way for IOs to improve their regulatory performance. Some IOs already engage actively with private actors and institutions—we provide a range of illustrations, highlighting the activities of the UN Environment Program (UNEP). Yet there remains a significant “orchestration deficit” that provides real opportunities for IOs. We draw on the lessons of existing IO activities to suggest additional possibilities for improving IO performance.",

      "Key Findings": "In the context of growing shortages of affordable housing in Alberta, the policy discourse in the last decade has centered on ways to get the private sector involved through a variety of public-private partnerships, policy incentives and regulatory measures. This research explores alternatives for private sector engagement in the provision of affordable housing focusing on four clusters of policy instruments—regulatory/planning, fiscal, financial and institutional. \n\nThe article provides a much-needed overview of challenges and opportunities in Alberta using conceptually appropriate analytical framework, fresh empirical evidence, case study analysis and insights from the practical experiences of industry professionals. It argues that a much more robust and sustainable system of direct subsidies is required to bridge the funding gap between the cost of development and potential revenue generation in affordable rental housing. In addition to fiscal support from senior governments and improved access to more affordable long-term finance, it suggests that municipalities can play a significant role in facilitating private sector involvement by creating a positive planning and policy environment. Key recommendations in that regard focus on density bonu@sing, streamlined development approval and acquisition of land through land trusts and land leases.",

      "Key Findings": "This paper examines water use efficiency and economic efficiency with a particular focus on the Murray – Darling Basin of Australia and the stated policy goal of increasing environmental flows of water in the Basin. The different measures of efficiency are explained, and their implications for water reform and the efficacy of market based approaches to addressing the water scarcity issues and environmental flow needs are explored. Public policies to subsidize investments for improvements in irrigation efficiency are shown not to be currently cost effective compared to alternatives, such as buying water through water markets. The implications of these findings, and the factors that determine the demand for irrigation water by competing uses, can guide policy makers undertaking water reforms in the agricultural sector to mitigate the environmental consequences of overuse of water resources.\n",

      "Key Findings": "Public–Private Partnership is a relatively new approach to housing provision and was introduced in Nigeria to address the burgeoning housing challenges. To date, little is known about the contribution of this approach to improving the chances of low-income earners in gaining access to decent and affordable housing in urban areas in this country. Based on data obtained from a survey of selected government housing agencies in six cities in southern Nigeria, this study found that the Public–Private-Partnership approach, like most previous public housing delivery strategies, has not made any significant contribution to housing low-income earners; rather it is skewed towards providing housing for high- and middle-income earners. This paper identifies the state-market structure of the Public–Private Partnerships and the absence of a National Policy on Public–Private Partnership in housing in Nigeria as being responsible for this development.",
      "Key Recommendations": "It suggests that the development and adoption of a uniform National Policy on Public–Private Partnership in housing, government provision of land at no cost to private developers, lowering of the high building standards, and incorporation of assisted-self-help and incremental housing into the Public–Private-Partnership housing delivery system will ensure better results.",

      "Document Title": "Determinants of PPP in Infrastructure in Developing Economies",
      "Key Findings": "The purpose of this paper is to analyze the factors that determine Public Private Partnership (PPP) in infrastructure by using a unique data set on Private Participation in Infrastructure (PPI) for the period 1990 2008. The study mainly focuses on developing countries, because these countries need PPP arrangement more urgently than any other group of countries. \n\nDesign/methodology/approach – For the analysis, a range of advanced panel estimators, namely random-Poisson, negative binomial, random-generalized least square (GLS), random tobit, zero inflated Poisson (ZIP), are utilized to overcome the potential data related problems and for the robustness check of the estimated results.\n\nFindings – The results of the analysis suggest that large size and relatively higher income markets attract more PPP projects. The empirical evidence also suggests that macroeconomic stability, quality of regulation and governance are important factors in determining PPP in the infrastructure. Surprisingly, however, the evidence fails to provide any strong support for the role of political factors and budget constraint in the process.\n\nPractical implications – The findings of this study will help the policymakers of developing countries in framing up such policies, so as to encourage more private firms to engage in infrastructure building through PPP.",
      "Key Recommendations": "From a policy perspective the implications of our results are straightforward. As in most of developing countries, the gap in demand and supply of infrastructure is wide, the public sector is more or less inefficient and governments have budget constraint. In addition, there is a high possibility of private investment crowding out if public expenditure is increased on infrastructure projects. In light of this scenario, PPP arrangement could be a viable and reasonable choice for the policy makers in developing countries. However, the task is not so easy; as our results suggest that it requires a stable macroeconomic condition, which means that governments in the developing countries have to provide stability in the macroeconomic arena by controlling the excess volatility and ensuring enough safety mechanism in the place. Furthermore, to increase the portfolio of PPP projects, developing countries must be prepared to improve overall macroeconomic management, absorb additional explicit and implicit fiscal risks through pursuing strict discipline in fiscal policy. In this context, controlling and managing subsidies on the basis of the political consideration could be a crucial factor. These subsidies often lead to fiscal leakage, inflation, crowing out of private investment as well as fiscal deficit in the developing countries.",

      "Key Findings": "Public-private partnerships governing global health are making progress in relation to the prevention and treatment of diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. This progress should not be underestimated as these partnerships are making strides above and beyond efforts of either the public or private sector alone. As a consequence, partnerships are increasingly exercising public power over global health in addition to, or instead of states and International organisations and are thus also becoming capable of adversely impacting the rights of individuals, in particular the right to life and the right to health. Responsibility under international law therefore arises as an issue but, at the moment, partnerships are not directly addressed by the rules of responsibility under international law. This Article describes global health public private partnerships and discusses how public power over global health is increasingly being exercised by these partnerships thereby necessitating a further discussion on responsibility under international law.

      "Key Findings": "In the Philippines, skepticism about private sector participation in urban water provision became increasingly pronounced as missed service targets and regulatory battles plagued governmental relations with the two companies (Manila Water and Maynilad) granted concessions for water provision in the capital, Manila. A comparative study of these two public-private partnerships (PPPs) reveals the challenges of reconciling bureaucratic and organizational dynamics with public suspicion of the private sector. This study draws on interviews and observations with corporate and government officials, academics, journalists, non-governmental organizations and civil society members in the Philippines, almost a decade after the initial privatization. This paper furthers our understanding of the outcomes in Manila—and PPPs more generally—by addressing the tension between credible commitment in contractual arrangements and flexibility for responding to economic and environmental shocks. It argues that adversarial interactions between the private corporations and regulators hindered the collaborative negotiations needed to respond to the currency crisis.",

      "Key Findings": "Around the world, publicly owned and run health services face challenges. In poor countries in particular, health services are characterized by such problems as inadequate infrastructure and equipment, frequent shortages of medicines and supplies, and low quality of care. Increasingly, both developed- and developing-country governments are embracing public-private partnerships to harness private financing and expertise to achieve public policy goals. An innovative form of these partnerships is the public-private integrated partnership, which goes a step further than more common hospital building and maintenance arrangements, by combining infrastructure renewal with delivery of clinical services. We describe the benefits and risks inherent in such integrated partnerships and present three case studies that demonstrate innovative design. We conclude that these partnerships have the potential to improve access, quality, and efficiency in health care. More such partnerships should be launched and rigorously evaluated, and their lessons should be widely shared to guide policy makers in the effective use of this model.",

      "Document Title": "Health Research Systems: Promoting Health Equity or Economic Competitiveness? ",
      "Key Findings": "International collaborative health research is justifiably expected to help reduce global health inequities. Investment in health policy and systems research in developing countries is essential to this process but, currently, funding for international research is mainly channeled towards the development of new medical interventions. This imbalance is largely due to research legislation and policies used in high-income countries. These policies have increasingly led these countries to invest in health research aimed at boosting national economic competitiveness rather than reducing health inequities. In the United States of America and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the regulation of research has encouraged a model that: leads to products that can be commercialized; targets health needs that can be met by profitable, high-technology products; has the licensing of new products as its endpoint; and does not entail significant research capacity strengthening in other countries. Accordingly, investment in international research is directed towards pharmaceutical trials and product development public–private partnerships for neglected diseases. This diverts funding away from research that is needed to implement existing interventions and to strengthen health systems, i.e. health policy and systems research. Governments must restructure their research laws and policies to increase this essential research in developing countries.",
      "Key Recommendations": "To begin, high income country governments should design and enact policies that: (i) create strong incentives for health policy and systems research; (ii) support higher education and university departments in such research; and (iii) foster health policy and systems research partnerships between public research bodies, academia, health providers and private foundations. To encourage this kind of research, governments could, for example, create a fund source by applying a tax to the profits from products derived from trial data collected in developing countries. Governments could then distribute the funds in response to open competitive tenders. Research tax credits could be extended to health providers and research institutions that conduct health policy and systems research.",

This paper addresses the role of local government in coordination with provincial and federal government for the development of sustainable megacities by utilizing the assistance of global-capital. We tried to address degree specific 132 indicators to construct the benchmark for megacity which could describe the sustainability level of megacity that how and by which process the same transaction is possible or implementable.",

Perhaps the strongest evidence for the business case for sustainable finance, however, is the growing level of interest and practice among large financial institutions, a testament to the commercial incentives latent in paying heed to ESG concerns.",

A key tension to be managed is keeping the costs of the network down while ensuring that every member is adequately incentivized. \n\nSocial implications – The 3,000 women sales agents in rural Bangladesh engaged with the Rural Sales Program have benefited from earning viable incomes in contexts where opportunities for employment and empowerment of women are limited. Rural populations have gained affordable access to socially beneficial goods such as fortified foods, seeds, daily necessities and shoes. Companies have benefited from learning how to adapt their product offerings to meet the needs of low-income customers.",

First, it examines the approach to foreign aid being used in South Sudan, which reflects the new thinking in providing assistance to post-conflict countries. The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) adopted the extensive empirical work by Collier, Hoeffler, and Soderbom in its policy and program guide to economic growth in post-conflict countries.2 Second, by building upon this new approach the paper suggests how foreign aid can mitigate the risk of violent conflict recurring in the newly independent South Sudan. It explores strategies for growth and development by encouraging the private sector to take the lead in addressing key impediments to business development, trade, and investment.\n",

Additionally, the article intends to critically assess conflicting and overlapping views on contractual and institutional PPPs, their forms and models, and draw insights for transitional economies.\nThe article concludes that future PPP research in transitional countries such as Kazakhstan and Russia, particularly in the area of organisational and power arrangements in partnerships, may delineate new concepts such as government as a guarantor of a PPP project, social significance of a PPP project, and risk management in a country’s contextual environment. \nIn transitional countries, in which PPPs are in their infancy, clarification\nof theoretical positions, and identification of commonalities and differences between meanings attached to the PPP terminology may enable better decisions by researchers and practitioners in their selection and further development of partnerships and related concepts.",

      "Key Findings": "The President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), established in 2003, is widely recognized as one of the most ambitious and successful bilateral programs ever implemented to address a single disease. Part of the program’s success is attributable to the participation of the private sector, working in partnership with the US and local governments and implementing organizations to maximize the reach and effectiveness of every dollar spent. We examined key public-private partnerships that grew out of PEPFAR to identify features that have made them effective. For example, PEPFAR’s Supply Chain Management System took advantage of private industry’s best practices in logistics, and a partnership with the medical technology company BD (Becton, Dickinson and Company) improved laboratory systems throughout sub-Saharan Africa. We found that setting ambitious goals, enlisting both global and local partners, cultivating a culture of collaboration, careful planning, continuous monitoring and evaluation, and measuring outcomes systematically led to the most effective programs. The Office of the US Global AIDS Coordinator and PEPFAR should continue to strengthen their capacity for private-sector partnerships, learning from a decade of experience and identifying new ways to make smart investments that will make the most efficient use of taxpayer resources, expand proven interventions more rapidly, and help ensure the sustainability of key programs.",
      "Key Recommendations": "In the coming years, PEPFAR should continue to broaden its capacity for private sector partnerships, learning from its first decade of experience and identifying new ways to make smart investments that will deliver even more value for money in such areas as integrating the private sector into health service delivery, increasing the supply of trained health workers, expanding workplace programs for HIV prevention and treatment, and integrating strategies that address the health needs of women and children, such as reducing gender based violence, into the entire spectrum of PEPFAR’s activities at the country level.",

      "Key Findings": "Health systems strengthening (HSS) is being increasingly recognized as a strategic crosscutting issue in all World Health Organization (WHO) work. Health systems comprise six building blocks: service delivery; medical products, vaccines and technologies; health workforce; health systems financing; health information system; and leadership and governance. Public–private mix (PPM) approaches or partnerships consist of initiatives aimed at increasing collaboration and improving the relationships between public–public, public– private and private–private health providers. An important component of PPM is the clear distribution of tasks between the different providers involved in the provision of health care. In practice, most PPM initiatives are disease-specific and are often related to the health service delivery block mentioned above. Although there is widespread consensus that PPM initiatives are typically of an HSS nature, efforts to make explicit the links between PPM and health systems building blocks are rather uncommon. The present paper aims to identify – in order to facilitate operationalization – potential aspects linking PPM to health systems building blocks, using a few experiences from tuberculosis control and beyond. The paper targets policymakers, donors and health systems scientists and ends with a call for more aware and innovative leadership, for increased support of PPM initiatives covering various building blocks, and for more operational research.",

Department of Defense leaders are expressing interest in implementing parallel approaches. PPC is intended to further policy objectives, enhance U.S. operational capabilities, reduce costs, gain access to nonmilitary expertise or assets, or build greater capacity in partners. As DOD adapts to meet evolving roles and missions in an unpredictable and complex world amid fiscal constraints, the expertise and involvement of the private sector, including nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), research institutions, and academia will be essential. ",
      "Key Recommendations": "This paper proposes broad recommendations to help provide a framework for the future of PPC in DOD. \n\nThe Defense Department needs to pay more attention to PPC, clarify authorities, and allocate appropriate resources. Incremental changes could bring benefits now, but systemic solutions will be needed for DOD to implement PPC on the scale that will be required to meet the evolving demands of the new strategic environment.  These significant steps could center on policy and doctrine, organization, training and education, and congressional support. ",

While in the 1970s, political- economic ideas built mainly on the “developmental state” informed the design of most of these agreements, the change in economic thought in the 1980s which ushered in the “neoliberal turn” has since influenced the design of most REI schemes in Africa, including the New Partnership for African Development. However, among other factors, inadequate transport infrastructure linking regions poses a major impediment to regional trade and development in Africa. The more so as most African governments are not able to meet up with the financial burden, pace and managerial capability for the efficient provision and management of regional transport infrastructure. The article explores the dilemma associated with the adoption of Public–Private Partnerships (“PPP”) as a mechanism for the provision of regional transport infrastructure in Africa. While sourcing infrastructure provision through the PPP mechanism has significant advantages, it is however also embedded with a complex financial, contractual and legal process. First, it explores the theoretical assumptions which inform PPP based on ideologies within law and development debates. It argues that theoretically, PPPs are reflective of the neoliberal policy set. Against the trajectory of governance in Africa, it critically foregrounds insights that are derivable from an application of Path Dependency theory to the institutional change which comes with the planned adoption of PPP at the regional level.",

      "Key Findings": "The World Health Organization advocates universal health coverage so that all people can obtain the needed health services without suffering financial hardships. In the Philippines, the government has included public-private partnerships (PPP) as among its strategies in pursuit of universal health coverage, as PPPs can help fund the immediate repair, rehabilitation, and construction of selected priority health facilities. It also encourages local government units to tap PPPs in improving their service delivery. Given all these, it is important to define PPPs and distinguish them from all other forms of public-private interactions. Public-private investment partnerships (PPIP) have been described as health-related PPPs that are potentially transformative for underperforming government-run health systems. A decision algorithm is proposed to help decide on the PPIP option to be considered and developed. Proposed partnerships must be need based with accompanying evidence and statistics, and long term in nature with a goal of achieving universal health coverage by improving access to health care and reducing the financial burden of out-of-pocket expenses.",
      "Key Recommendations": "A comprehensive health plan should clarify the role of PPPs in the health system and in attaining universal health coverage.\n\nA legal framework is necessary to protect the interests of both the public and private sector and to make them liable if the objective of the PPP is not attained.\n\nA regulatory framework—specifically a controlling body—is essential to keep track of projects, to police partners, and to assist in technical aspects of the partnership, among others.\n\nBoth public and private sectors must be ready and willing to enter into the partnership.",

      "Key Findings": "Tackling illegal fishing through traditional state-centred approaches\nhas proven difficult and largely ineffective in the extensive maritime\nenvironment of Southeast Asia, and particularly in the archipelagic state of Indonesia. This article focuses on the involvement of a new\nfor-profit actor — a private tourism dive operator — in addressing\nillegal fishing in a small island archipelago in eastern Indonesia. The\ncase study demonstrates that the dive operator has been able to employ conventional enforcement methods such as patrolling and the capture of illegal fishers, in combination with alternative approaches to addressing the root causes of illegal fishing. It also explores the relationship of the dive operator with civil society actors, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and various state agencies involved in maritime security and conservation governance in the area. With a particular focus on the dive operator’s relationship with government agencies, the case study shows that local governments are collaborating with private actors and providing opportunities for new kinds of enforcement agents since they themselves lack sufficient resources to patrol waters effectively. The dive operator, however, operates only within a space granted by the district government, and must invest considerably in this relationship to maintain his position.",

Private schools in Pakistan are considered to impart better quality education than the government-operated schools. Individuals or companies finance and manage these private schools as businesses and charge a fee. The fee varies depending on the school’s clientele. Some of the private schools do cater to lower income groups, while others cater to the elite.",

      "Key Findings": "Background: In Sub-Saharan Africa, policy changes have begun to pave the way for community distribution of injectable contraceptives but sustaining such efforts remains challenging. Combining social marketing with community based distribution provides an opportunity to recover some program costs and compensate workers with proceeds from contraceptive sales. This paper proposes a model for increasing access to injectable contraceptives in rural settings by using community-based distributers as social marketing agents and incorporating financing systems to improve sustainability.\n\nMethods: This intervention was implemented in three districts of the Central Zone of Tigray, Ethiopia and program data has been collected from November 2011 through October 2012. A total of 137 Community Based Reproductive Health Agents (CBRHAs) were trained to provide injectable contraceptives and were provided with a loan of 25 injectable contraceptives from a drug revolving fund, created with project funds. The price of a single dose credited to a CBRHA was 3 birr ($0.17) and they provide injections to women for 5 birr ($0.29), determined with willingness-to-pay data. Social marketing was used to create awareness and generate demand. Both quantitative and qualitative methods were used to examine important feasibility aspects of the intervention.\n\nResults: Forty-four percent of CBRHAs were providing family planning methods at the time of the training and 96% believed providing injectable contraceptives would improve their services. By October 2012, 137 CBRHAs had successfully completed training and provided 2541 injections. Of total injections, 47% were provided to new users of injectable contraceptives. Approximately 31% of injections were given for free to the poorest women, including adolescents.\n\nConclusions: Insights gained from the first year of implementation of the model provide a framework for further expansion in Tigray, Ethiopia. Our experience highlights how program planners can tailor interventions to match family planning preferences and create more sustainable contraceptive service provision with greater impact.",

      "Key Findings": "Governments have incentives to form integrated rules and institutions when they pursue international environmental cooperation. Under what conditions do they form environmental cooperation consisting of un-integrated rules and institutions? I argue that governments form integrated cooperation when they share convergent preferences over cooperation. They form unintegrated cooperation when they have divergent preferences. Preferences diverge under one of two conditions: (i) economic actors (“stakeholders”) responsible for the environmental problem operate in diffuse markets, or (ii) states have an asymmetrically interdependent relationship in managing the environmental issue. When neither condition holds, governments share convergent preferences over environmental cooperation. I evaluate the importance of stakeholder concentrations by studying patterns of cooperation on global environmental issues such as climate change, ozone layer depletion, biodiversity loss, and mercury pollution. I evaluate the importance of interdependence structures by studying patterns of cooperation on regional rivers, lakes, and seas. The analysis employs original data stemming from agreement texts, field surveys, primary-source interviews, field observations, primary texts, quantitative data, as well as secondary sources. Governments create integrated global environmental cooperation when stakeholders are economically concentrated. They create un-integrated cooperation when stakeholders are economically diffuse. On regional water bodies, governments form integrated cooperation when states share symmetrical exposure to pollution and other externalities. They\nform un-integrated cooperation when states have asymmetrical exposure. Neither the number of states with control over an environmental issue nor the wealth and geopolitical relations among\nstates better explain patterns of cooperation on global environmental issues or regional water bodies.",

      "Key Findings": "The key findings from this article can be broken down into the following: \n\n• Realism & contextUnderstanding the scale of the challenge—and the opportunity.\nThroughout our interviews, it was clear that companies taking the most ambitious action on sustainability were also the most realistic about the scale of the challenge—and are more likely to admit that business is not doing enough. Understanding the challenge also allows these companies to appreciate the opportunity for future growth in providing solutions to sustainability issues and to target strategies to achieve it.\n\n• Growth & differentiation\nTurning sustainability to advantage and value creation. One of the clearest insights from this year’s study is the emergence of a two-speed world in sustainability, between those companies still reacting to external expectations on sustainability and focusing on incremental mitigation, and those that see sustainability through the lens of growth and differentiation. For leading companies, many CEOs told us that the urgency of global challenges provides an opportunity to differentiate their products and services; to access new market segments; and to grow into new regions, countries and areas where their products can meet a pressing need.\n\n• Value & performance\n“What gets measured gets managed.” From carbon emissions to water footprints, tracking environmental measures is now commonplace across industries. Our research suggests that, for companies seeking to go beyond incremental change and tackle global sustainability issues, the challenge is two-fold: not just to measure and manage metrics of reduction and mitigation, but also to quantify the value of sustainability initiatives and more sustainable business models to the company, and to track their impact on the communities in which they operate.",

      "Key Findings": "There is broad acceptance that Public-Private-Partnership (PPP) can improve cost effectiveness and render more satisfactory performance of infrastructure projects. But it is also widely accepted that the PPP option is yet to be fully utilized for the building and management of infrastructures in Nigeria. The paper reviews PPP practices and institutional framework in Nigeria, compares them with what obtains in selected global best practice countries, and suggests how PPP can become self-sustaining. Among other recommendations, the paper calls for mainstreaming of PPP through an institutional restructuring process that creates a cocktail of full-service PPP agencies, vested with both regulatory and executive powers as is the case in many global best practice countries. Success with the proposed framework, however, calls for more holistic PPP legislation, sustainable long-term financing models, and a comprehensive business dispute resolution framework. ",
      "Key Recommendations": "•\tDecentralization of PPP planning, authorization, and implementation: A diffused PPP approval and engagement mechanism is necessary for mainstreaming PPP and ensuring value-for-money in capital budget implementation. Decentralized and simplified approval processes can speed up mainstreaming of PPP.\n•\tNecessity of specialized agencies for critical infrastructures: It is needful to have specialized PPP agencies for key infrastructures like highways, petroleum exploration and refining, gas pipelines, rail systems, ICT broadcasting, electricity, and so on.\n•\tImportance of Central full-scale PPP Agencies: Central PPP agencies equipped with strong capacities for regulation, planning, implementation, facilitation, and market development would make PPP execution and regulation more effective and efficient.\n•\tMDAs and the LGCs use PPP to support capital budget implementation: Fiscal Strategy Papers (FSPs) of government should encourage MDAs and the LGCs to finance/implement an increasing percentage of their capital budget through PPPs to instill fiscal discipline and the culture of cost recovery.\n•\tCreating a comprehensive dispute resolution mechanism: An unbiased and responsive dispute resolution mechanism, with dedicated courts for business disputes, would reduce sundry risks and render the business environment more investor friendly.\n•\tInevitability of a sustainable long-term financing model: A sustainable long term financing mechanism is critical for success of PPPs. It is quite inappropriate to finance infrastructure projects having long term payback period with loans from MDBs.",

      "Key Findings": "Over the last decade, the bottom-of-the-pyramid (BoP) approach has\ngained prominence as a tool of “inclusive” capitalism in sub-Saharan Africa. This approach reframes development as a seamless outcome of core business activities, one that can ameliorate poverty by bringing much-needed products and services to the poor and generating employment opportunities for informal and subsistence workers as “micro-entrepreneurs.” Yet while transnational capital has set its sights on Africa’s “underserved” yet potentially buoyant markets, BoP initiatives do more\nthan seize upon the entrepreneurial talent and aspirations of Africa’s informal economies. This article argues, rather, that these initiatives create BoP economies through a set of market technologies, practices, and discourses that render the spaces and actors at the bottom of the pyramid knowable, calculable, and predictable to global business. The article describes how these technologies extend new forms of\nmarket governance over the informal poor, reconfiguring their habits, social practices, and economic strategies under the banner of poverty reduction.

      "Key Findings": "Globalization processes have rendered non-state actors an integral part of global governance. The body of literature that has examined non-state actor involvement in global governance has focused mainly on whether and how non-state actors can inﬂuence states. Less attention has been paid to the comparative advantages of non-state actors to answer questions about agency across categories of non-state actors, and more precisely what governance activities non-state actors are perceived to fulﬁl. Using unique survey material from two climate change conferences, we propose that different categories of nonstate actors have distinct governance proﬁles. We further suggest that the different governance proﬁles are derived from particular power sources and that agency is a function of these proﬁles. The study thereby contributes to a strand in the literature focusing on the authority of non-state actors in climate governance and broadens the methodological toolkit for studying the ‘‘governors’’ of global governance.",

These efforts all require effective planning, open and transparent multi-sectoral dialogue, and careful monitoring of impacts and outcomes. The conducive national policy environment in Tanzania’s health sector has set a stage for improved public-private partnerships as well as private investments in health to expand fiscal space and enhance service delivery. However, there is a need for continual development of LGAs’ capacity to engage with the private sector, and the need to develop ever more sophisticated and mature mechanisms to finance investments\nfor improved service delivery in health. In terms of PPPs for health, Tanzania is a regional leader, with existing expertise and experience that can be drawn upon as part of the HFS reform.",

This paper analyses whether this unique PPP model protects the interests of both the public and private stakeholders, or is this just a means to public subsidizing of private interests? By drawing on evidence from primary and secondary sources, this paper finds that though some elements of PPP are present in these companies, they, as a whole, are not truly public private partnerships. They do, however, represent an innovative relationship between the public and private sectors.",

The study concludes with the finding and suggestions regarding the current status and scope of Social Entrepreneurship in UAE. In the suggestions, a model has been proposed which is an effort to streamline and utilize the resources for fostering Social Entrepreneurship through Public Private Partnership in the region.",

Despite its long history no consensus has been developed among the industry participants, academics or other interested parties. After a careful review of the complications and complexities of the CSR debate and distinct disciplinary deﬁnitions, the article turns to approach the problem of deﬁnition using the philosophy of science. It applies a scientiﬁc deﬁnitional approach of genus, differentia and species to arrive at a deﬁnition of CSR as international private business selfregulation. The article provides an overview of the implications of this deﬁnition on CSR as a ﬁeld of study, a management practice and an approach to improving the dialogue concerning the social contribution of business.",

Integrating current scholarship on the state as a catalyst of private regulatory regimes with prior literature on regulatory failure and self-regulation, it identifies and problematizes unsettled assumptions used as a starting point by this growing body of research. The case study traces the evolution of public debates and the interaction of different regulatory initiatives dealing with corporate social responsibility (CSR) issues in Canada's mining industry. Findings reveal the conditions under which the state is more likely to encourage firm-level, fragmented initiatives than facilitate and promote industry-wide regulatory strengthening and consolidation. I discuss the need for greater analytical precision regarding the variation in regulatory policy preferences across time and branches of government and the interaction between public and private regulatory initiatives. The conclusion outlines suggested areas for future research as well as the likely outcome of Canada's current CSR policy framework.",

Using data collected from 49 members of a rural social enterprise in North India, we examine the relationships between social entrepreneurship, empowerment and social change. Innovative business processes that facilitated women’s economic activity and at the same time complied with local social and cultural norms that constrain their agency contributed to changing the social order itself. We frame emancipatory social entrepreneurship as processes that (1) empower women and (2) contribute to changing the social order in which women are embedded",

      "Key Findings": "As concepts of corporate social responsibility (CSR) continue to evolve, the predicament facing CSR managers when attempting to balance the\ndiffering interests of various stakeholders remains a persistent management challenge. A review of the extensive literature in this\nfield reveals that the conceptualisation of corporate approaches to responsible stakeholder management remains underdeveloped. In particular, CSR practices within the specific context of the pharmaceutical industry, a sector which particularly dramatically depicts the stakeholder management dilemmas faced by business managers, has been under-researched. To address this gap, this paper\nutilises qualitative, exploratory data, obtained via multiple research methods, to investigate the CSR practices of major pharmaceutical companies in the UK and Germany. The data are employed to critically re-examine and revise a previously published explanatory framework\nwhich identifies the management steps involved in CSR stakeholder\nengagement. The resulting revised explanatory framework\nis the main contribution of this paper. By abstracting those\nfactors which influence CSR practice, it provides an analytical tool\nwhich is designed to be of practical use for business decision-makers when managing their stakeholder engagement activities. Given that the research addresses values and ideals and prescribes practical recommendations for practitioners, it is essentially applied and normative in nature. Ultimately, the framework proposes a set of steps for developing CSR strategies which could help CSR professionals to make a ‘mindset transition’ from a narrower ‘traditional’ approach to CSR to a more innovative way of thinking.

      "Key Findings": "Public and private joint ventures in varying capacities and contexts, commonly referred as Public - Private Partnership (PPP) has attributes like fast-paced developments, optimum utilization of diversified skills and accelerated growth of domestic expertise. Bank, Asian Development (September 2008) describes it as an arrangement, encompassing wide range of possible relationships among public and private entities. An effective partnership assigns tasks and optimally undertakes the obligations. In developing such a partnership, it involves government functionaries and municipalities. Private partnership holds domestic as well as international enterprises in its folds. In a bigger canvas of civil sector developmental activities, it also falls in the realm of community participation which inherits ownership and long-lasting sustenance of national projects. In developing countries like Pakistan, it is rather essential to have collaborated partnerships for accelerated economic growth. Insufficient capacity of the public sector to develop and provide essential services to the community is one aspect which accentuates private sector's participation in such projects. Private sector's sharing of obligations towards general public builds the spirit of community life, strengthens socio-economic fabric of the society and exhibits national character. Despite having wherewithal of a vibrant civil sector, Pakistan's public management has not been able to exploit the potentials of their private partners. On the other hand, private enterprises have grown in capacity, knowhow on technology and management expertise of smaller to mega projects. Somehow public and private sectors in Pakistan have not been able to build comradeship for productive ventures. The issue has become complex due to intellectually incapacitated government machinery and their deficient comprehension of world-wide developments in finding solutions through innovations. Their notion of creating justifications on papers and routing case files through sluggish channels provide sufficient grounds for the private sectors to remain away. Under such muddling environments, domestic investors turn their energies towards other countries. Shortfalls of public-private partnerships in Pakistan appear to be the issues of management attitude. Its positive developments shall build confidence and trust for speedy public sector developments in wider spectrum.",

      "Key Findings": "Ending malnutrition in all its forms will drive sustainable development forward. This point needs to be emphasized more strongly in efforts to achieve and monitor the Sustainable Development Goals. Although a great deal of progress is being made in reducing malnutrition, it is still too slow and too uneven, while some forms of malnutrition, namely adult overweight and obesity, are actually increasing. Concrete action to address malnutrition, backed by financing, is being scaled up—but not nearly enough to meet the 2025 World Health Assembly (WHA) targets or the SDG target of ending malnutrition in all its forms by 2030. Commitment to and financing for nutrition will need to be ramped up significantly if we are to meet these eminently reachable global targets. A virtuous cycle of improved nutrition and sustainable development can be unleashed if action to address malnutrition in all its forms can be embedded within key development sectors. The accountability of all nutrition stakeholders needs to improve if this virtuous circle between sustainable development and nutrition is to be fully realized. Significant reductions in malnutrition—in all its forms—are possible by 2030.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. MEET TARGETS ON NUTRITION OUTCOMES AND PRAC-\nTICES, AND DELIVER ON COMMITMENTS TO TAKE ACTION.\nCountries, aid donors, development agencies, compa-\nnies, and many others have made public commitments to combat malnutrition in recent years. It is time to\nmake good on these commitments.\n\n2. UNLEASH THE VIRTUOUS CIRCLE OF IMPROVED NUTRI-\nTION AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT. The forces that prevent good nutrition status are powerful and multi-\nsectoral, and they need to be counteracted by forces that are equally powerful and multisectoral.\n\n3. STRENGTHEN ACCOUNTABILITY IN NUTRITION. Our ability\nto hold duty bearers accountable for their commitments\nneeds to be strong. Strong accountability will give all\nstakeholders—existing and new—more confidence that\ntheir actions will have an impact, that bottlenecks to\nprogress will be identified and overcome, and that their\nsuccesses will inspire others.",

      "Key Findings": "The role of the private sector in climate ﬁnance is increasingly emphasized in international political debates. Knowledge of private engagement in mitigating climate change and in more advanced economies is growing, but the evidence base for private-sector engagement in climate change adaptation in developing countries remains weak. Starting from the premise that the private sector’s role in adaptation is often inevitable and potentially signiﬁcant, this article ﬁrst analyses the potential of private-sector engagement in adaptation and adaptation ﬁnancing in developing countries by conceptualizing the private sector’s roles and motivation therein. For further inquiry, and for a discussion based on a developing-country context, interviews were conducted with key stakeholders for adaptation of Zambia’s agricultural sector, including on ways in which the government can incentivize private-sector engagement in adaptation. How much private-sector adaptation and adaptation ﬁnance can be identiﬁed depends on the interpretation of the concept of adaptation. Under a broad interpretation, the domestic private sector in particular can contribute substantially to adaptation, both directly and indirectly, through its investments and activities. However, the international private sector’s role in ﬁnancing adaptation should be analyzed under a strict interpretation of adaptation and appears limited.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Governments thus have to carefully design incentives for private-sector engagement in adaptation. This was outside the scope of this article, and private-sector awareness of adaptation might first need to grow further, but, in the future, a more extensive study on the impact and required policy framework for private-sector engagement in adaptation could really benefit adaptation processes in countries like Zambia.",

These findings contribute to micro-level considerations within institutional theory which view legitimacy as socially constructed between legitimacy seeker and conferrer. Hence, we add another perspective on legitimation to the previously existing conceptualizations of legitimacy as a deterministic consequence of institutionalization.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Further investigations are necessary to sharpen our understanding of legitimation work. Possible research questions include whether the two dimensions of legitimation work, namely avoiding and ensuring, are substitutes, mutually enforcing, additive, or independent from each other.

      "Key Findings": "Defining DoD’s role in using humanitarian health programs for security goals can and should be done. I propose such a definition, but only to begin discussion. Equally important is the implementation of scientific evaluation of humanitarian missions. This can be done quickly, without new authorization or appropriation legislation. Then DoD can get on with the business of national security, using the humanitarian response tool in the most effective ways. For DoD to avoid this “easier service” trap in its humanitarian efforts, we must be clear in our intentions, sustainable in our actions, and compulsively thorough in our evaluations. Together, even in the face of a tenuous link between health interventions and peace outcomes, DoD can deliver on its peace and security mandate to the taxpayers and the Congress",
      "Key Recommendations": "I believe there are potential solutions for the challenges of validating DoD’s engagement in humanitarian work for security objectives. There are two essential ingredients: DoD must first define exactly what it hopes to accomplish. Second, DoD should monitor and evaluate its efforts with greater rigor. ",

It is also true that the economic and political clout received from their donor empowers NGOs to act against the governments of the countries in which they work.\n\nThis article has shown that in certain instances, NGOs, largely due to ideological and financial reasons, have adopted policies and strategies against national interests of the states in which they operate.

Practical implications – The partners’ opposing perspectives on a\nnumber of PPP issues show that management needs to identify and\ncarefully reconcile stakeholder values in a partnership in order to\nachieve more effective PPP governance. Practitioners, particularly those\nin the public agencies, have to be concerned with ways to reduce the\ngovernment overregulation of the private operators, which is likely to\nresult in greater PPP flexibility in management and, ultimately, higher\nefficiency in delivering the public services.",

      "Key Findings": "The proliferation of public–private partnerships (PPPs) for development as an answer to many public challenges calls for careful evaluation. To this end, tailored frameworks are fundamental for helping understand the PPPs’ impact and for guiding corrective adjustment. Scholars have developed frameworks focusing on the partners’ relationships, the order of effects, and the distinction between outputs and outcomes. To capture a PPP’s complexity and multiple linkages with its environment, we argue that a thorough evaluation should adopt a stakeholder- oriented approach and consider the costs and benefits that a PPP implies for them—especially as taxpayers’ money is (at least partly) involved. For this purpose, we build on a stakeholder-oriented evaluation framework from the nonprofit business partnership literature. In line with our broad evaluation conception, we extend it with the manifold ripple effects that PPPs for development have and include the time dimension for the links between different PPP stages and related outcomes to become clearer. Applying this framework to an illustrative case, we highlight important direct and especially indirect stakeholder outcomes, which a narrow evaluation would omit, point to the challenges involved in the evaluation endeavor, and identify interesting future research areas.",

In this article, the literature on innovation networks is used to construct a conceptual framework that describes the structure and mechanism of interaction in technological public–private innovation networks. In the framework, innovation is created through a dynamic process of interaction between the public and private actors along the network lifecycle. In each stage of network lifecycle, social capital enables various interactions to occur and different modes and quantities of knowledge and technological resources to be exchanged and reinforced. Through a combination of the product lifecycle model and social network analysis, the structure of technological public-private innovation networks are examined at each stage of the lifecycle to reveal information about how the roles of public and private actors are embodied.",

We argue that, from a market-based perspective, conventional innovation adoption models based on instrumental factors do not fully consider speciﬁc characteristics of social innovations. Our objective is to improve the explanatory power of conventional adoption models by including symbolic, emotional, and motivational factors as non-instrumental factors. We conducted two empirical studies in which we investigated younger adults’ adoption intentions regarding time-bank-based senior cooperatives. The results extend the ﬁndings of conventional adoption research and show that explanatory power can be substantially improved by including non-instrumental factors. The results contribute to the understanding of social innovation adoption and indicate limited generalizability of conventional innovation adoption research to social innovations. Implications and directions for future research are discussed.",

In the case of China, the priorities include the establishment of regulatory agencies, clear legislation and better understood fair exit mechanisms (Asian Development Bank, 2014).",

      "Key Findings": "This paper, aimed at assessing the achievements of public-private partnerships (PPPs) as well as the obstacles to the effective implementation of PPPs in local governments in Ghana observed that PPP has been applied in the provision of different local government services in the two districts of Ga West and Adentan. The use of PPPs has chalked up some form of benefits amidst major structural and institutional challenges. The study concludes that PPP has good prospects of enhancing the provision of local government services, if laxities are addressed.",
      "Key Recommendations": "The potential benefits of PPP in developing countries like Ghana cannot be overemphasised. Several benefits could be derived from using PPPs as development strategies for local government’s infrastructural development and service provision. They include improvement in the quality of service delivery; infusion of private capital and technology; cost savings to local government and value for users’ money; reduction in the size of the local government workforce, improvement in managerial efficiency and effectiveness; risk sharing with multiple actors; promotion of good governance; accelerated delivery of needed infrastructure and public services on time and within budget; increased international and domestic investment; technology transfer and capacity building; provision of innovative design, technology and financing structures.",

Grounded in interpretivist research methodology, using the survey research strategy and using secondary data sources in the form of a desk survey, it concluded that there is a case for the increased use PPPs to finance economic development. It further concluded that while there is demonstrated appetite for PPPs, to date, only a few projects have been procured through PPPs.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Hence, moving forward, and given the deteriorating revenue situation, there is a need to use more PPPs to deliver\neconomic development. Finally, the paper argues that there is a need to reform the current PPP legal-institutional architecture and bench-mark and peer-learn from best PPP practices in Africa such as South Africa and Nigeria and beyond.",

      "Key Findings": "The article presents an analysis of trends in organizational, industrial and infrastructural development of innovative territorial clusters (ITC) in the Russian Federation. Parameters and characteristics of subsidies allocated from various sources for these purposes in 2013-2015 are disclosed. The study of the conducted ITC’s support policies reflects the concentration of clusters’ control levers by the regional authorities, that causes certain risks of clustering processes containment in general. The spatial and temporal unevenness of clusters’ organizational development process, the instability of their financial support and strengthening the vertical channels of influence that could give rise to corruption, stagnation and ignoring the views of cluster participants when making strategic decisions are revealed. The authors reveal the necessity of conceptual enrichment of the methods and tools of formation and implementation of ITC’s strategies aimed at achieving high feasibility and concretization of their goals and means, providing strong link between tactical measures and ongoing projects, and balancing the interests of stakeholders. It is proved in the article that the urgent task of enhancing the state of clustering policy in Russia has become a framework to improve the quality of ITC’s projects initiated and creating an adequate system for monitoring the effectiveness of their implementation. While assessing the ITC projects it is proposed to take into account the investment effectiveness, associated with the home region development strategy, sectoral strategies, profile programs of companies’ innovative development on the public-private partnership basis, regional universities development programs, as well as the similar projects implemented in other regions of Russia.",

However, although private universities and university colleges are many in number, enrollment has continued to be higher in public universities. It was further noted that an increase in higher learning institutions and subsequent increase in access to higher education has not meant an improvement in the quality of education provided by the institutions. As such, PPPs have had no significant impact on the improvement of quality of education. This is mainly accounted for by the number and qualifications held by academic members of staff in private universities, the infrastructure as well as the programmes they offer.",

      "Key Findings": "Do foreign private investments (originated through public-private partnerships) improve the Water and Sanitation Sector in developing countries? I synthesize market sympathetic and skeptical arguments by noting that their relative salience depends on the level of corruption in a country. Specifically, I argue that private investments can effectively provide water and sanitation through public-private partnerships if they are adequately governed by the state. When corruption is high, however, private actors will pursue profit maximization over public needs, which leads them to provide water but not adequate sanitation. I test these arguments using a cross-sectional time series of fifty-six non-Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries from 1991 through 2012.",

The global health community engages corporations – and CSR – through public-private partnerships. We have argued this value approach leaves out the importance of CSR policies as part of a “new governance” framework that shapes corporate policies and business’ evolving role in society. We have called this framework the CSR system, which is based on a definition of CSR as a set of “processes of mutual governance between business, civil society, national governments and international organizations” in the management of business’ role in society. This encompasses the more common definitions of CSR based on business motivation.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. Put CSR standards for women’s health on the global health agendas a core issue\n2. Target key institutions tha`t can drive CSR policy change\n3. Leverage existing relationships and existing issues\n4. Generate data, evidence and tools related to workplace health policies and practices\n5.

      "Key Recommendations": "As this very nascent field continues to grow, more research will be needed to capture lessons learned, contextualize them within the larger landscape of ECD financing and service provision, and apply them to real-world social challenges with the world’s youngest and most disadvantaged populations at the forefront of the conversation.",

      "Key Findings": "Historically, the relationship between the private sector and international development has been deeply ambivalent. For many, a vibrant private sector and competitive markets are the essential prerequisites of development. For many others, development is principally concerned with ameliorating the dislocation associated with capitalist profit seeking. In the last generation, this ambivalence has given way to an emphasis on the complementarities between the private sector and development. Yet skeptics have continued to criticize the form of development this trend has promoted. We review the historical conditions behind this trend; the controversies concerning transnational corporations and foreign direct investment; the rise of corporate social responsibility; the parallel rise of philanthrocapitalism; and the growth of micro-credit as a marketoriented vehicle for poverty alleviation and empowerment. When taken together, it is clear that private sector actors have become increasingly influential in the new landscape of development, yet their effects remain ambiguous.",

      "Key Findings": "Historically, the relationship between the private sector and international development has been deeply ambivalent. For many, a vibrant private sector and competitive markets are the essential prerequisites of development. For many others, development is principally concerned with ameliorating the dislocation associated with capitalist profit seeking. In the last generation, this ambivalence has given way to an emphasis on the complementarities between the private sector and development. Yet skeptics have continued to criticize the form of development this trend has promoted. We review the historical conditions behind this trend; the controversies concerning transnational corporations and foreign direct investment; the rise of corporate social responsibility; the parallel rise of philanthrocapitalism; and the growth of micro-credit as a market-oriented vehicle for poverty alleviation and empowerment. When taken together, it is clear that private sector actors have become increasingly influential in the new landscape of development, yet their effects remain ambiguous.",

      "Key Findings": "There has been a steady decline in private sector contribution to FP service delivery since 1995, when 64.3% of FP users obtained their methods from the private sector.\n\nKey challenges that hinder the private sector’s contribution to FP service delivery are: (1) lengthy and complicated registration procedures, along with a rigid pricing system, which limit the range of family planning methods available on the market; (2) FP method stock-outs often due to lengthy importation procedures; (3) low demand for contraceptives.\n\nDespite the above challenges, this study identifies several opportunities for an increased role for the private sector in family planning service delivery.\n\nOwing to their on-going relationships and established rapport with their customers, private physicians and pharmacists are well positioned to address reasons for unmet need for family planning, such as infrequent sex, fear of method side-effects, and husband’s disapproval.\n\nAt the policy level, amendments made by the Egyptian government to existing investment laws could make the Egyptian market more attractive to pharmaceutical companies.\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. Adopt a total market approach whereby MOHP facilities target those who live in remote rural and low income urban areas; NGOs target lower middle-class women; private doctors target middle- and upper-class women; and pharmacists target all groups of women and possibly husbands.\n2. Create demand for private FP services through social marketing campaigns that specifically target young couples, those in the upper two wealth quintiles, and those who live in urban areas. \n3. Capitalize on all opportunities to counsel women and their husbands about FP including during antenatal care, postnatal care, and children’s health care visits.\n4. Educate physicians and pharmacists about new family planning methods through brochures, newsletters, conferences, and medical representatives.\n5. The private sector should make services more attractive to clients through enforcing service delivery standards, upgrading their FP knowledge and skills and offering extended hours and\nadditional services.",

Participants highlighted that the change in the macro-economic environment following the 2008 financial crisis affected national policy in donor countries and subsequently the number of new commitments IFFIm received. Since Gavi is now seen as a successful and mature organization, participants stated that donors prefer to donate directly to Gavi. The pharmaceutical industry valued IFFIm for providing funding stability and flexibility. Other stakeholders valued IFFIm’s ability to access funds early and enable Gavi to increase vaccine coverage. Overall, stakeholders thought IFFIm was successful, but they had divergent views about IFFIm’s on-going role. Participants listed two issues where bond financing mechanisms may be suitable: emergency preparedness and outcome-based time-limited interventions.",
      "Key Recommendations": "IFFIm-like mechanisms have been proposed to fund a wide range of other global health issues, including malaria control, Ebola vaccine and noncommunicable diseases.\n•\tFirst, bond financing could have a role in emergency preparedness, including disasters and pandemics.\n•\tSecond, bond financing could support quantifiable, outcomes-based, time-limited interventions, including the formation of a new organization or delivery of a specific intervention, for example a catch-up vaccination program.",

The findings suggest that there is lack of clarity in the objectives of the program, particularly with regards to the role of the key stakeholders including academics, government institutions, policymakers and the private sector. The results underscore the need for sound and clear-cut government policies toward entrepreneurship development that will foster a better relationship between the African governments and the United States Agency for International Development program.",
      "Key Recommendations": "•Encourage entrepreneurship training and education for youth and women: Government policy that targets entrepreneurship training and education for youth and women should be encouraged in Africa. Specifically, developing a specialized program on informal entrepreneurship that is integrated into the curriculum and funding a program for African entrepreneurship trainers should be the focus of the policy.\n•Integrate a participatory approach into multi-stakeholder partnership: The majority of the respondents emphasized that a participatory approach through multi-stakeholder partnership for entrepreneurship development should be encouraged.\n•Adopt the triple helix concept to strengthen stakeholder partnership: Building on the issue of stakeholder partnership, the triple helix concept can play an important role in the implementation of the YALI program.\n•Learn from emerging economies: Government partnership with the transition or emerging economies for entrepreneurship development should be given more priority in Africa, as advocated by some respondents.",

      "Key Findings": "As India continues to experience rapid urban expansion, public and private leaders at a national, state, and local level are looking into ways to better manage larger populations and unlock greater economic potential. Launched under Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2015, the Smart Cities Mission is an ambitious multiyear effort to boost economic development, technological innovation, and sustainable growth across 100 cities. Learning from previous national urbanization initiatives, the Smart Cities Mission promises to simultaneously improve the infrastructure and built environment in Indias expanding cities while offering a new path to urban fiscal health. If successful, Indian cities will position themselves as clean, modern, and competitive places for years to come.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Fortunately, a series of distinct policy recommendations can help Indian cities design smart cities plans, improve their implementation, and build their economies.\n\nFirst, India must focus on creating more customized solutions as part of its Smart Cities Mission, which should be shaped according to local infrastructure priorities and institutional capabilities.\n\nSecond, India must look to improve government capabilities at all levels to accelerate future urban development efforts.\n\nThird, India must elevate the financial standing of its urban areas, making them more attractive destinations for future investment.",

      "Key Findings": "This paper has six sections. Section I presents an overview of key findings and recommendations. Section II paints a picture of an effective 21st century U.S. development function. Section III provides a brief history of aid reform and sets out the principles upon which the paper is based. Section IV identifies elements of the current aid reform agenda that merit continued cultivation. Section V sets forth additional ideas for further action. Section VI outlines the need in the future for a mutual cooperation and partnering approach for U.S. global engagement as assistance declines as a source of development solutions.\n\nThe recommendations following each narrative generally are tiered in order of importance and impact, but not always. Certain suggestions serve as alternative options. This paper deals mainly with the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), which, as the principal U.S. development agency, has been at the center of the aid reform agenda. Other U.S. government agencies are brought into the analysis where they are relevant to specific issues.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Recommendations:\n• One-stop-shop: Business has long complained about having to go to multiple U.S. government agencies to find the one program that might support its interests and the slowness in working through the bureaucratic maze to get an answer, even a “no.” Power Africa reportedly has made interagency collaboration work—hosting multiple agencies at the same meeting with a U.S. company facilitates quick identification of which agencies might support the company’s planned project. This experience should be built upon to create a formal one-stop-shop, both online and a staffed office, for business looking for engagement with U.S. foreign affairs agencies, as would be authorized by S.3227, the Economic Growth and Development Act, introduced by Senator Johnny Isakson.\n• Comprehensive interagency engagement package: Short of a one-stop-shop, again building on the experience of Power Africa, a strategy and interagency capability should be created to provide an integrated business engagement package of support involving USAID, Department of State, USDA, OPIC, USTDA, Export-Import Bank, and the Commerce Department so as to provide comprehensive support for engaging U.S. companies in development activities.\n• Evaluation of PPPs: A formal assessment of USAID’s PPPs should be undertaken, both as a mechanism for engaging the private sector and as a way to produce development results. Assess the impact of PPPs, the sustainability of results, the measurement of outcomes, and the value of the GDA model, including whether the 1:1 finance match requirement is beneficial or a distraction. Analyze the roles of commercial interest and shared value in a partnership to determine whether they are key indicators of the likelihood of sustainability and should serve as filters in assessing prospective partnerships. Review the role and value of dedicated relationship managers and whether they should be full-time positions.\n• Strategic engagement: Using the experience of the BAA, assess how to better engage the private sector in strategic discussions in the design phase of programs and policies.",

      "Key Findings": "Since the 1990s China has emerged as one of the world’s most active markets for public-private partnerships (PPPs) in water and sanitation, while the private sector has played a rather limited role in the water sector in India. From 2001 to 2012, there were 237 PPP projects in water and sanitation in China, accounting for 40% of the total number of such projects globally, and the Chinese population served by private water companies increased from merely 8% in 1989 to 38% in 2008.\nDevelopment of PPPs in the water sector in India during the same\nperiod was insignificant. Our comparative analysis of PPPs in water and\nsanitation in the two countries highlights the importance of water tariff\nreform, strong support and oversight from the national government,\nand the availability of credible regulatory mechanisms to safeguard\ndevelopment and sustainability of PPPs in the water sector.",

PPP has a long history in developed countries, but the approach has only recently gained attention as a method for boosting economic growth and development in developing countries. The article argues that the companies‘ motivation for participating in PPP in Somalia extends beyond the conventional objective of commercial considerations to the moral imperative of supporting members of the umma (community), despite considerable risks, and is at the forefront of Turkey‘s interest in Africa.",

      "Key Findings": "Results: Healthcare sustainability is a complex, multifaceted and multi-pillar problem. PPPs can enhance, or damage, all healthcare sustainability pillars due to a complex conflict of interest between the parties involved. Embedding certain governance mechanisms in PPP contracting and management is necessary to foster both financial and non- financial sustainability in healthcare provided via PPPs. Some countries and some PPPs have managed to develop suitable mechanisms to govern the conflicting goals in healthcare management.",

      "Key Recommendations": "For future studies, it would be interesting to verify some of the hypotheses that emerge from this research. For example, to analyze if the learning costs absorbed by the PPP, as being one of the first in the service sector, were indeed overcome in the design and implementation of subsequent Sectoral Brands. On the other hand, considering the general framework of the PPP, it seems necessary to evaluate the trade promotion policy for Chilean services export in the last decade in Chile, to the extent that there is an evident public speech that places this sector as a priority within trade policy, which is questionable in the light of the findings of this research.",

      "Key Findings": " Definition of the concept of public-private partnership (PPP) in Romania becomes essential in the conditions of a rigid legislation that is constantly changing, updating, republicating or repealing. In the current European and international context, where PPPs are gaining momentum and are considered to be real tools for financing major infrastructure projects urgently needed for the development of a state, understanding the concept of PPP brings important clarifications to the use of this new type of public-private cooperation. The scope of application, the eligibility of the private partner, the PPP contract and the financing mechanisms are fundamental elements of the concept of public-private partnership. The European Union, international organizations such as the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and international bodies such as the World Bank or the European Investment Bank are constantly concerned about the implementation and improvement of public-private partnerships, considering them as concrete ways of solving the needs of developing countries, a cooperation that goes beyond the public sector's boundaries through financial contributions and influx of expertise in the matter brought by investors as private partners of public authorities. Legislative developments in the field of PPP in Romania have been troublesome and failed to provide a stable and secure framework for potential private investors. In 2016 a new law is approved in the desire to shed light on the matter and to bring the necessary provisions and clarifications for the successful implementation of such partnerships in Romania",

      "Key Findings": "The private sector is one of the sources of finance included in developed countries’ pledge in the UN climate negotiations to mobilise $100 billion annually by 2020 to support developing countries’ efforts to address climate change. For adaptation in particular, it remains unclear what mobilised private finance is. Research so far has focused on its potential and experiences in developing countries, but not on the arguments of those who introduced and continue to advocate private adaptation finance: developed countries. This paper investigates the positions of developed countries and development banks and agencies. In particular, it aims to identify whether those actors can reach a common understanding of private adaptation finance that minimises norm conflicts in a fragmented climate finance system. Empirically, the paper examines the Biennial Reports and submissions on Strategies and Approaches for Mobilising Scaled-up Finance of six developed country parties, as well as data from interviews with experts from development banks and agencies. The analysis finds a number of discrepancies between these sets of actors, for example on motivations for and modes of private sector involvement. This discrepancy is the result of ambiguity around the concept of private adaptation finance in a highly fragmented climate finance architecture. This ambiguity is problematic when the aim of mobilising private adaptation finance is to contribute to the $100 billion commitment. However, if the aim is adaptation in practice, both ambiguity and fragmentation might actually make the climate finance system more inclusive and innovative",
      "Key Recommendations": "However, if the aim of mobilising private finance is to reach the $100 billion commitment, the climate finance system requires a more static and integrated architecture.\n\nAlternatively, the aim could be output: maximising the mobilisation of effective private investments (rather than finance) in resilience and reducing vulnerability, regardless of whether these constitute climate finance or not.\n\nRather than being fixated on reaching the $100 billion commitment, the climate finance system should aim for adaptation output. This might also enhance innovation and include more actors in the system.",

      "Document Title": "The Sustainable Development Goals and the Global Health Security Agenda: exploring synergies for a sustainable and resilient world",
      "Key Findings": "Both the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA) represent bold initiatives to address systematically gaps in previous efforts to assure that societies can be resilient when confronted with potentially overwhelming threats to health. Despite their obvious differences, and differing criticisms of both, they shift away from vertical (problem-or disease-specific) to horizontal (comprehensive) solutions. Despite the comprehensiveness of the SDGs, they lack a specific target for global health security. The GHSA focuses primarily on infectious diseases and neglects non communicable diseases and socioeconomic drivers of health. Even though each agenda has limitations and unique challenges, they are complementary. We discuss ways to understand and implement the two agendas synergistically to hasten progress toward a more sustainable and resilient world.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. Increase financial support for SDGs and GHSA implementation by enhancing private sector engagement and domestic resource mobilization and allocation.\n\n2. Increase fiscal support for SDGs and GHSA by encouraging OECD countries to achieve their target Overseas Development\nAid (ODA) of 0.7 per cent as agreed by donor nations at high-level international development conferences and by mobilizing G20 nations (an international forum for the governments and central bank governors from 20 major economies founded in 1999 to study, review, and promote high-level discussion of policy issues about international financial stability) to allocate greater resources toward health.\n\n3. Engage civil society for GHSA advocacy and support.\n\n4. Facilitate implementation of SDGs and the GHSA through incentives and by developing five-year plans.\n\n5. Enhance governance structures to include political accountability for IHR implementation during outbreaks and ensure transparency for SDG implementation.",

      "Document Title": "Are public-private partnerships the solution to tackle neglected tropical diseases? A systematic review of the literature",
      "Key Findings": "Pharmaceutical companies are reluctant to invest in research and development (R&D) of products for neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) mainly due to the low ability-to-pay of health insurance systems and of potential consumers. The available preventive and curative interventions for NTDs mostly rely on old technologies and products that are often not adequate. Moreover, NTDs mostly affect populations living in remote rural areas and conflict zones, thereby hampering access to healthcare. The challenges posed by\nNTDs have led to the proliferation of a variety of public-private partnerships (PPPs) in the last decades. We conducted a systematic review to assess the functioning and impact of these partnerships on the development of and access to better technologies for NTDs. Our systematic review revealed a clear lack of empirical assessment of PPPs: we could not find any impact evaluation analyses, while these are crucial to realize the full potential of PPPs and to progress further towards NTDs elimination.",
      "Key Recommendations": "To deal with this lack of transparency and ensuing shortage of data, one could require partnerships to register on a single platform, on which partners would have to declare all funding received; investments made; starting and ending dates of each clinical step; etc. This incentive to the public provision of information on partnership could be enhanced by a scheme, as suggested in the literature: “transparency in exchange for public funds.”\n\nIn addition to the lack of data, the research is challenged by the absence of a counterfactual to which PPPs for NTDs could be compared; as it is unlikely to see non-PPP models for diseases that mainly affect the poor. However, assessing how different characteristics of PPPs – such as geographic coverage, stakeholders involved, funding and governance structure – affect the desired outcome would already provide good insights into how the model could be optimized; shedding light on the drivers of their success or failure.",

      "Document Title": "Development Finance Takes ‘Private Turn’: Implications and Challenges Ahead",
      "Key Findings": "In recent years, policy debates on development finance have been dominated by how to ‘leverage’ international private capital flows for development projects. The outcome of the Third International Conference on Financing for Development, held in Addis Ababa in July 2015, also included an unchecked promotion of private finance through blended finance and public–private partnerships, even though these mechanisms do not have a great track record.",
      "Key Recommendations": "First, the use of public finance to subsidize, guarantee or leverage private finance should be carefully evaluated: a review led by developing country stakeholders, under the auspices of the UN, could be a good start.\n\nSecond, the international community has to tackle the perverse incentives in favour of PPPs.\n\nThird, there is a need for a standard-setting process for PPPs to take place in an inclusive and transparent way.",

      "Key Findings": "Danish foreign aid has moved from a combination of a set of values (human rights, democracy, good governance, sustainable environments, gender equality, etc.) and a concern with the ideas in the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness (ownership, alignment, harmonisation and mutual accountability) towards a strong focus on short-term Danish non-development interests. The policies increasingly seek to satisfy Danish commercial interests through development cooperation, and choices of partner countries, sectors and multilateral development activities are no longer strongly related to perceived need but rather made on the basis of investment potential, security risk, migration concerns and Danish (often commercial) capacities. The share of aid reaching developing countries is highly fluctuating, as bilateral budgets suffered a great blow between 2015 and 2016 when they were almost halved. Unsurprisingly, aid predictability has been weakened greatly at the hands of shifting priorities, leaving partner countries unable to trust in the persistence and dependability of Danish aid.",

      "Key Findings": "This article explores an initiative located in central Mozambique, the Beira Agricultural Growth Corridor (BAGC). It shows how the international fertiliser company Yara set out to enrol actors at different levels in business, governance and agricultural development into BAGC as a public-private partnership to promote commercial agriculture. Very soon, however, Yara made shifts in its engagement and market strategy, leaving the BAGC initiative to supporting donors and local producers. The analysis presented here shows how the tension between ‘patient-capital’ requirements, high risks and low immediate returns have shaped this case over time – in a context of a national political economy framed by extractive-resource dynamics.",
      "Key Recommendations": "National as well as international public actors need to increase their direct support and commitment to agricultural development – at appropriate scales, and in ways that take local knowledge, local investment priorities and local time horizons seriously. The experiences represented by the remaining actors in the BAGC Catalytic Fund may provide valuable lessons informing such a reorientation.",

At the same time, actors such as private businesses have become increasingly involved in disaster efforts. In this paper, we begin to fill the gap in the cross-sector literature regarding interactions that have systemic impacts by investigating how the simultaneous processes of systemic change and intensifying cross-sector interaction worked and interacted in the context of the preparedness system. We examine these inter-linkages through a qualitative study in the setting of Hurricane Sandy. Drawing from systems theory, we develop a grounded model that provides an explanation for the system change and highlights how cross-sector interaction relates to the changes observed in the system.",

      "Key Findings": "Since the early 2000s, regimes and institutions of global governance have undergone a paradigmatic shift in their relations with multinational corporations. The United Nations, in particular, has increasingly embraced big business as ‘partner’ in humanitarian response and development with the establishment of ‘global public private partnerships’ (GP3s). This article situates this emerging mode of global governance within the recent academic discussions on Global Constitutionalism from a critical political economy perspective, focusing on the case of the UN Refugee Agency’s GP3s in refugee protection and assistance. Critically inquiring into GP3s not only as informal global constitutional arrangements but also as a set of political relations, this article asks: what is the constitutional and political nature of UNHCR– business partnerships? What impacts, if any, do they have on the agency? And, what does this mean for understanding global constitutionalism? The article argues that UNHCR partnerships are constituted as asymmetrical political relations in terms of their distributions of power, benefits, risks and commitments, that they are having neoliberal-oriented constitutive effects on the agency and that these constitutional dynamics challenge the more mainstream and liberal-based conceptualisations, analyses and promotion of current global constitutionalism processes.",

      "Key Findings": "Despite decades of international political emphasis, little is known about the in-country determinants of technology transfer for climate change mitigation. We draw upon the conclusions of a series of standardized, official governmental statements of technology priorities, coupled with questionnaire-based data collection, to shed light on the nature of those determinants. We find that there is a disconnect between what developing country governments perceive as the key enablers of, and barriers to, technology transfer, and what bilateral and multilateral technology transfer programes can offer, given budgetary constraints and the logic of development aid spending. We show that the well established notion of making climate change mitigation actions an integral part of sound development plans is especially relevant for technology transfer. We offer pointers as to how this might be done in practice, in the context of the ‘technology action plans’ developed as part of the United Nations-sponsored technology needs assessment process.",

Finally, PPPs require support from not only local governments or private operators but also from local citizens and other community organizations. Overall, effective leadership is what ties all these factors together. ",

      "Key Findings": "Although multinational operations have the potential to benefit communities in the Pacific, they can also disrupt local values and principles and lead to more individualized practices, ultimately having negative impacts on community well-being. This article illustrates two specific cases of this, highlighting the disjunctures between indigenous perceptions of the good life in Fiji and Papua New Guinea and experiences of “development” associated with large-scale mining and tourism operations. Yet the gap between the aspirations for community well-being and development and their fulfillment is also the space where opportunities exist to advance meaningful forms of development.",
      "Key Recommendations": "We believe that if multinational companies genuinely seek to support locally meaningful forms of human development, they must find points of connection with indigenous values of well-being and development.\n\nWe argue that recognizing the value of the collective good to indigenous communities must be a key component of any form of community development intervention.",

      "Key Findings": "Kazakhstan has put in place a well-structured legal and institutional framework for preparing Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) at both the national and regional levels. The government has prioritised PPPs as a delivery mode for both economic and social infrastructure. The central emphasis on PPPs had a strong impact at the regional level with a large number of relatively small projects signed in the past years. At the national level the impact has been modest mostly due to financing challenges. In terms of priority areas for reform, the report outlines capacity building (particularly during the project preparation phase), the need to promote quality over quantity of PPPs, strengthening the methods used to guide the choice of delivery mode, and transparency\nand accounting of contingent liabilities",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. Strengthen central government support for PPP preparation and monitoring at the regional level.\n2. Ensure coherence between the PPP Law and other relevant legislation.\n3. Adopt sector standards for PPPs.\n4. Reform the domestic financial system so that it becomes a more effective partner for infrastructure development.\n5. Demonstrate long-term commitment to private financing.\n6. Ensure project documentation matches international standards.\n7. Leverage public resources to mobilise private financing. \n8. Strengthen partnerships with MDBs.\n9. Develop a clear policy and limits on guarantees for PPPs.\n10. Strengthen central government support for PPP preparation and monitoring at the regional level.\n11. Maintain the rigour of the current gateway process while simplifying the analytical requirements for smaller projects\n12. Develop clear guidance and transparent criteria for prioritising all infrastructure projects, including PPPs and concessions\n13. Develop clear guidance and transparent criteria for prioritising all infrastructure projects, including PPPs and concessions.\n14. Ensure that the choice of delivery mode is grounded in value for money analysis rather than budget expediency.\n15. Expand data collection on PPPs.\n16. Assign responsibilities and allocate resources for conducting independent ex post evaluations.\n17. Kazakhstan could improve transparency of PPP procurement process.\n18. Kazakhstan could develop additional tools to improve the way PPPs are treated in the budget process.",

      "Key Findings": "Public‐private partnerships (PPPs) in public health have gained great attention in the global health literature over the last two decades. Evidence suggests that PPPs could contribute to mitigating complex health problems. There is, however, limited knowledge about the process and specific conditions in which PPPs for healthy eating, in particular, can be developed successfully. To address this gap, this article first summarizes the literature, and second, using qualitative content analysis, identifies factors deemed to influence the process of building PPPs for healthy eating. The literature search was undertaken in two stages. The first stage focused on PPPs in public health to understand what constitutes a PPP, and the types and characteristics of PPPs. The second stage sought empirical examples and conceptual papers related to PPPs for healthy eating to identify critical elements that could facilitate or hinder partnerships between the government and the food industry. The search yielded 38 articles on PPPs in public health and 20 on PPPs for healthy eating. The analysis generated 23 individual elements that have the potential to influence a successful process of building PPPs for healthy eating (eg, endorsement from an individual champion, equal representation from partner organizations on board committees). The analysis also yielded five factors that appeared to well represent the 23 individual elements of PPP formation: motivation, enablers, governance, benefits, and barriers. These results constitute an important step to understand critical factors involved in the formation of PPPs in public health and should inform additional empirical research to validate them.",

      "Key Findings": "Along with the new challenges in the process of adapting to the market economy, targeting the demand and supply law, the competition law and the process of Romania's integration into the European Union, the rehabilitation of transport infrastructure, water supply, waste recycling, environmental protection, monitoring state aids, ensuring a loyal and predictable business environment, are the main reasons for using public-private partnership as a way of working together between the public sector, the initiator of public utility projects and the private sector, the fund holder and the executive management. Increasing the availability of the private sector to take on a range of responsibilities and risks as well as the public sector to privatize public utility services has resulted in the multiplication of efforts to introduce the concept of public-private partnership to achieve economic and social objectives and projects from Romania. Over time, the concept of public-private partnership has been the subject of legislative regulations both in the Member States of the European Union and in Romania, which recently adopted a new normative act on this type of partnership and which constitutes a objective of the Governance Program over the period 2018-2020 on the objectives of economic growth and strengthening fiscal-budgetary sustainability by significantly increasing the budget-financed investments or by accelerating the absorption of the European funds and by stimulating private investment. In view of the above-mentioned aspects, we propose that through this paper we address the theoretical issues of the public-private partnership and from the investigations carried out to highlight the advantages and the limits of a partnership of this kind, but also the main categories of institutions that are most effective in realizing of such partnerships with major benefits for the entire national economy.",

      "Key Findings": "The complexity of public–private partnership (PPP) projects ensures that risks could emerge and spread in unpredictable ways if they are not well identified and managed. The emergence of PPP projects has brought major changes in the construction industry, the most notable being in procurement methods influencing risk allocation to private parties. Thus, it is crucial to have an effective risk management for public and private partners to eliminate or minimise risks. Formulating an effective risk management system is a crucial challenge faced by both of parties in order to minimise or optimise risks. The aim of this study was to investigate the process of risk identification of private partners in Malaysian PPP projects. Data were collected throughout a 2-month period using a survey with a sample of nine Malaysian companies engaged in PPP projects, and the survey results were analysed using mean scores. The findings indicate that due to a lack of knowledge and experience of Malaysian private partners in the risk identification process, a comprehensive database for risk identification is highly necessary for the private sector. Another issue emerging from the findings is that it may be reasonable to use a combination of risk identification tools for PPP projects with a high level of complexity. The findings of the present study can greatly assist public and private partners to select the most appropriate tools for risk identification at the early stages of PPP projects.",

To reach the agenda’s objectives, the international community needs to find ways to effectively harness the public and private sectors. The SDGs are integrated and indivisible, with progress in one area dependent upon progress in others. Both the private and public sector are needed to meet the health-related SDG 3, including the target of universal health coverage (UHC) and related goals such as SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth) and SDG 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure).",
      "Key Recommendations": "Here we suggest the following approach to managing, and where appropriate, engaging the private sector as part of efforts to achieve UHC.\n\nFirst, governments should take the lead and formulate domestic health goals and priorities.\n\nSecond, as the private sector is heterogeneous, context-specific policy approaches are required to align the work of the private sector with the goal of achieving UHC.\n\nThird, is implementation of the government’s policy on the role of the private sector for UHC, with a mix of legal and financial regulatory tools to manage the private sector and steer efforts towards achieving UHC.",

In a number of countries, anti-crisis packages included innovative public actions, realized also in combination with private investments, like in the case of public-private partnership (PPP), which combines the resource of government agents with those of private agents in order to realize public-interest aims. In this study, we have conducted a general analysis on PPP models, in order to present some evidences from a comparison between European Union with 28 countries (EU-28) and Italy in the 2008-2016 period, with specific considerations on the energy sector. The various trends demonstrate a substantial evolution about global numbers and values of the PPP initiatives in EU-28 and Italy, and underline several constraints and challenges for successful PPP projects, even specifically for the energy sector.",

      "Key Findings": "For doses, SMGL implemented many activities in year 1, including the following:\n\n• 1,548 individuals trained as safe mother action group (SMAG)members\n• 236,483 birth plans distributed\n• 93 Change Champions trained\n• 2,027 Mama Packs (containing cloth diapers, diaper fasteners,\ntraditional chitenge cloth, laundry bars, bath soap, and baby hat)\ndistributed to women at facility delivery\n• 94 facilities upgraded to BEmONC capacity (some still unable to\nperform vacuum assisted deliveries)\n• 199 health workers trained in EmONC\n• 256 health workers trained in SmartCare\n\nIn terms of reach, for the intervention districts, nearly 90% of women who delivered at facilities had heard of SMGL, mostly from radio broadcasts and health providers. Almost 70% of women in SMGL districts used at least one intervention, with 25% reporting the use of transport vouchers. Providers in SMGL districts were twice as likely to have received obstetric training during the past year compared to those in non-SMGL districts.\n\nThere were also outlying dynamic effects: SMGL raised awareness of maternal mortality within and beyond focus districts. While it also had mostly positive “spillover” effects on the broader\nhealth system (e.g., service delivery, medicine procurement,\ninformation systems). Women in the community were enthusiastic about SMGL—specifically the work of the SMAGs. Most women who delivered at home said they did so due to\nthe sudden onset of labor, lack of transportation, and concerns\nabout disrespectful treatment. Women also reported social pressure to deliver in facilities; some who delivered at home felt stigmatized. Lastly Women and local leaders confirmed that those who delivered at home were made to pay penalties in many villages.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. Commit to five years – with a clear transition plan: SMGL partners should make minimum commitments of five years to enable appropriate planning, engagement of local ministries, sequencing of interventions, and planning for sustainability.\n2. Think in terms of health system packages and not isolated\ninterventions: Investments in surgically-equipped facilities, medicine supply chains, health workers, and clinical skill acquisition are mutually- reinforcing and essential for creating a culture of competence necessary for high quality care.\n3. Training is not enough – consider other cost-effective models\nfor improving care quality: Trainings were the most rapidly and extensively implemented activities of SMGL.\n4. Focus on “last mile” women: Even with expansion of obstetric\nfacilities and transport solutions, many women in rural areas will live too far to reach facilities for delivery.\n5. Clarify the SMGL governance structure – globally and in host countries: At the global level, the SMGL Leadership Council should define a governance structure with clear roles and responsibilities for funding and implementation.",

Furthermore, it found that including renewable energy to the  technical and economic simulations did not add much to the understanding of the main stakeholders regarding renewable energy development.\n\nThe regional integration component of the project led to increased regional cooperation with Georgia while the stakeholders believed that the renewable energy task (better understanding of renewable energy policy and regulations) did not receive as good results as the tasks on nuclear energy and interconnection. Out of the project's three main tasks increasing regional integration was the most relevant to the priorities of the GOA, followed by activities on nuclear energy and the least relevant was renewable energy task.",

      "Key Findings": "This report details the PALM project which was engaged in a wide range of activities which were valued by the relevant counterparts.: PALM played an important role in supporting the Ministry of Labor and Social Issues (MLSI), State Revenue Committee (SRC), Ministry of Finance (MoF), and Central Bank of Armenia (CBA) in drafting and revising pension laws and other legal acts to establish the legal framework of the new multi-pillar pension system in Armenia. The project has also provided support for the Multi-Pillar Pension System in numerous areas and considerable support to the SESA and to the Youth Professional Orientation Centre (YPOC). 5. The Performance Management Plans (PMPs) for PALM, including the final PMP, correspond well to the Expected Results in the contract Statement of Work (SOW).",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. USAID staff and implementation partners should re-double efforts toward clear communication with\ncounterparts at every level from the outset of any future project in the pension area concerning the\npurpose and mandate of the project, the priorities, and the constraints that exist in terms of budget and\nother resources, laws, rules and regulations.\n2. The follow-on pension reform project should have a strong, national, and full-time pension legislation\nexpert.\n3. USAID should work with MLSI to help develop staff below the senior level to serve as active\ncounterparts to the follow-on pension reform project, including a skilled pension modeling expert.\n4. If in the future USAID determines that it should develop significant labor market or employment\nprograms in Armenia, an evaluation component should be built into the projects from the beginning,\nincluding the collection of relevant data before the beginning and as the project is being implemented.\n5. Care should be taken in developing the SOW for future USAID projects to identify linkages between\nresults and expected outcomes in as concrete a way as possible and provide some guidance concerning\nhow the contractor and the USAID mission at the outset of the project may be able to develop\nmeasures of accomplishment.",

Behavior change, especially gender transformation, takes time, continued funding, and intensive commitment from national organizations and donors. CHAMPION worked diligently to achieve its goal of promoting national dialogue on men’s roles to increase gender equity and reduce vulnerability to HIV and other adverse RH outcomes. Its five objectives were to reduce partner and high-risk behaviors, promote fidelity, create an enabling environment for gender-equitable norms, reduce GBV, and\nencourage men to seek clinical health services, and ultimately prevent HIV.",
      "Key Recommendations": "The ecological model implemented by the CHAMPION project must be adapted and tested\nin new projects to demonstrate its efficacy and value. \n\nData should be valued, consistently and purposefully collected, analyzed, and shared, rather\nthan being used only to fulfill reporting requirements. \n\nThe target population should be expanded to children and youth. \n\nLeaders of religious and community organizations, local government, and traditional\norganizations have proved to be essential allies to CHAMPION’s community work. \n\nCHAMPION’s reach should be expanded to rural areas. \n\nInstitutionalization of gender equity and male involvement messages is essential and\nshould have high priority.

ProVIC reached its target OVC beneficiaries who were receiving at least one service depending on need, of which school fees and health care were primary. Since ProVIC there has been an increase in the demand for HIV screening at the PMTCT centers, possibly partly motivated by the increased availability of ARV drugs in addition to the ProVIC awareness-raising activities. ProVIC has been most effective in its work with MSM.  Integrated project management—although a single management structure facilitates coordination of a single project offering the full HIV package, problems of harmonization of components persisted.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Overall: Place zone at the center of programming to include clinical services, systems\nstrengthening, and a robust community component, with special programs for key populations,\nOVCs, care, and support. Realize the benefits of the capacity-building investment to date and\ncontinue support to stronger NGOs. Keep the community involved and strengthen Ministry of\nHealth (MOH) health committees",

      "Key Findings": "The article suggets that they found that a large number of activities were carried out within the first year of SMGL and SMGL was generally well received by women in communities, although there was anxiety about continuation of the program after the end of year 1. In both Uganda and Zambia, providers in SMGL districts scored modestly better than their counterparts in comparison districts on a test of obstetric knowledge. The majority of implementers, national stakeholders, and community respondents felt that SMGL was instrumental in raising awareness of maternal mortality in the focus districts. In general, SMGL’s global leaders agreed that the SMGL partnership was greater than the sum of its parts because it leveraged more resources and garnered creative new ideas for action on maternal health from a broad and non-traditional group of constituents. ",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. Commit to five years—with a clear transition plan\n2. Think in terms of health system packages and not isolated interventions\n3. Training is not enough—consider other cost-effective models for improving care quality\n4. Focus on \"last mile\" women\n5. Clarify the SMGL governance structure—globally and in host countries\n6. Test future intervention packages using rigorous evaluation methods",

      "Key Findings": "Though the performance of the project has been mixed, USAID/DELIVER has successfully operated PSCs and made procurement on behalf of the United States Government (USG) and has institutionalized a logistics management information system (LMIS) in Malawi. The influence of USAID/DELIVER lies in its ability to pursue long-term goals and encourage Malawi government ownership of some or most of the activities. Since USAID mandated one-year plans for 2012 and 2013, the approach has changed to a short-term vision and strategy, which has not benefited the project.\n\nSome activities in the work plan were not begun; others were carried out beyond their target, such as \"number of  unannounced spot checks conducted at third party warehousing and transport operations\". Data produced by the outdated LMIS system are not secure or validated; to be used at the central level, they must be thoroughly cleaned. The whole USAID/DELIVER management and reporting structure merits thorough USAID review to ensure that for the rest of the contract period the project complies with standard reporting procedures and that meaningful indicators of progress (output, outcome and impact) are linked to objectives and set reporting formats to track quarterly progress  for all indicators.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Recommendations:\n\nUSAID should consider:\n1. Reinstating multiyear strategies, work plans, and performance frameworks.\n2. Including cost-effectiveness parameters and value for money in future SCM contracts.\n3. Performance-based financing that directly links a portion of the funding to results.\n4. Promoting discussion within the health donor community about how to strengthen plans for the future “integrated” supply chain and potential support to CMST during the transition period.\n5. Shifting verification of self-reported data to external organizations that can conduct rigorous representative evaluations for annual performance reviews, LMIS, and assessment of national\nstorage systems.\nFor its part, the USAID/DELIVER Project should consider:\n1. Identifying meaningful indicators to track SCM performance and draft PMPs with indicators linked to objectives and to outcomes, outputs, and impact over the strategy period.\n\n2. Drawing up, with USAID approval, multiyear country strategies and work plans, with HTSS-P inputs from the outset.\n\n3. Improving quarterly report quality by reporting activities and indicators consistently.\n4. Working across other commodity groups, such as essential drugs, and collecting data for quantification.\n5. Resolving data inaccuracies between reports.\n6. Facilitating selection of the e-LMIS by MOH and CMST, the eventual system users.\n7. Reviewing the costing structure of PSC and other SCM services and ensuring accountability and transparency.\n8. Whether the project will have a role during transition to the integrated national supply chain.\n9. Heightening support for capacity-building support in such cross-cutting areas as governance and leadership.",

      "Key Findings": "The Institutional Assessment Report provided a vision and implementation plan to achieve sector reform, and was well received by the sector stakeholders. However the implementation of the core reform agenda has been stalled by political factors and resulting changes in leadership positions within the Ministry of Water and Irrigation (MWI). It is apparent that ISSP was not designed to achieve sustainable reform, but rather to advance the reform process sufficiently such that the momentum for reform becomes irreversible. The flexibility of ISSP has meant that it has been able to make progress on multiple fronts, so that delays in one area do not significantly affect overall progress. ISSP was designed to be an instrument of serious sector reform, but has faced some opposition to the proposed reforms. This has delayed implementation and required ISSP to become engaged in other supportive activities to keep the project running.",
      "Key Recommendations": "- The ISSP program has moved the process forward but follow-up is needed to see it through. A more focused program based on the core reform agenda is required for the future, with clear steps and commitments from GOJ before proceeding to the next step.\n- Given that ISSP is not intended as the vehicle to fully implement the reform agenda for the water sector, by way of an exit strategy, ISSP should undertake a detailed forecast/assessment of the resources required to see the reforms through to practical completion, and recommend modalities for how this can be accomplished.\n- ISSP, and USAID, will need to continue to find effective ways to exert influence at the political level.\n- ISSP should explore the benefits (to both sides) of establishing a stronger working relationship with the GiZ Water Program at the Ministry, including co-financing opportunities and the synergies that would result.",

      "Key Findings": "UCP is on track to achieving targets set by USAID. In 2012 a UCP assessment of the impact of the performance improvement intervention on selected health outcomes failed to find substantial improvement. From the onset, UCP facilitated ownership through dialogue, leadership, and decision making among stakeholders, bringing together government ministries, PFNPs, DHPs, IPs, and others to drive the implementation of interventions. There was minimal focus on PNFPs in the original UCP design.",
      "Key Recommendations": "At the Technical Level (USAID and UCP)\n Review, reduce and rationalize the intervention mix to focus on those most essential to reinforce the capacity of MOH and districts to lead, prioritize, monitor, and be accountable for national HRH functions\n Expand use of the extensive HRIS data to advance workforce analyses and projections to include but not be limited to analysis of disaggregated data to advance health workforce planning.\n\nAt the Policy Level (USAID and GOU)\n Enhance engagement of multiple stakeholders, and create strategic alliances, including public-private partnerships with non-traditional partners such as businesses and electrical and Internet companies to strengthen sustainability of HRIS.\n Reinvigorate stakeholder ownership to review, strengthen, and upgrade pre-service nursing and midwifery education to ensure that the country produces the number and quality of nurses and midwives needed to meet national health priorities, especially reduced maternal mortality.\n Negotiate a plan between GOU, multilateral stakeholders, and the private sector to continue to strengthen HRH policy, planning, systems development, and continuity with clearly defined activities and dates for a full hand over of all functions to the government, and explore opportunities to setting up a public-private venture for\nestablishing a National Health Leadership, Management and Professional Development Institute.",

      "Key Findings": "In the horticulture sector, PRICE succeeded in job creation; however, while job creation exceeded its Life of Project (LoP) targets, this success is a result of seasonal labor among horticulture farmers. PRICE interventions in the horticulture sector did not regularly create full-time jobs for women. Due to cultural and social limitations, women were only moderately empowered in decision-making about agricultural inputs and production.\n\nPRICE training increased women’s technical skills in horticulture and aquaculture production, specifically at the homestead level, which increased family incomes. PRICE interventions strengthened capacity among aquaculture value-chain actors and for business membership organizations (BMOs) to carry out interventions to resolve sector constraints following project completion. Through PRICE SME initiatives, SMEs were able to gain access to markets, financial services, and training; the aggregation of SMEs into the Leather Technology Small Entrepreneurs Association (LTSE) served as the most valuable SME development initiative.",
      "Key Recommendations": "- Given the low domestic demand for horticulture products, USAID should emphasize linking horticulture producers with international exporting processors.\n- Agricultural loans should also facilitate sustainable credit practices through support that identifies and develops business models to provide adequate training and knowledge among beneficiaries.\n- USAID needs to examine how to apply the COEL job creation model in other sectors, as COEL contributed to women’s empowerment and strengthened job creation for women.\n- In the leather sector, future projects should assist large manufacturers in finding price-competitive international markets.",

      "Document Title": "Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Collaborative Research on Adapting Livestock Systems to Climate Change: Report of the External Evaluation Team submitted to the Bureau for Food Security, US Agency for International Development ",
      "Key Findings": "The ALSCC Innovation Lab has funded 12 Seed Grant Projects in  East and West Africa, Mongolia and Nepal in years one and two while 10 long term Research Projects were funded and are currently operating in East Africa (4), West Africa (2) and Nepal (4). 10 TIRI scholars  have been funded in East Africa with an additional 18 Scholars funded in Nepal. Six to eight additional TIRI Scholars are likely to be funded in Senegal based upon review of revised research proposals on a team model. In addition, 15 graduate fellows from Africa and Nepal are being supported for post-graduate qualifications either in the US or in host country research/academic institution with six TIRI Scholar Workshops organized in Nepal, Ethiopia and Senegal. Communication and dissemination: The ME created an attractive, informative and current website; also Facebook and LinkedIn profiles. In addition, Research Communiques and other publications serve to disseminate program accomplishments and research findings.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. A focused research strategy emphasizing adaptive capacity for poor livestock keepers and corresponding to Feed the Future priorities should frame and structure all program activities and expenditures.\n2. Research projects should integrate gender and nutrition dimensions and expertise from the start, climate change must be inherent to funded projects, and community demands and interests must shape program focus.\n3. Capacity development activities should be connected to the research dimensions of the projects and focused on durability.\n4. The ME leadership team should proactively develop and guide outreach and communications to internal university and external (USAID Missions, NGOs, universities, policy makers, public and private sector partners) stakeholders as well as to the global donor and academic community in this field.\n5. The ME team’s work should be guided by clear position descriptions tied to program activities and be supported by adequate time allocations for the Director and Associate Director.",

      "Document Title": "Evaluation of the More Investment in Sustainable Alternative Development and Areas for Municipal Alternative Development programs ",
      "Key Findings": "The evaluation found many sustained organizations, infrastructure works and productive activities, in all departments. Communities and projects were highly motivated, even in the face of adversity, to succeed and expand. Newer associations, especially with unfamiliar crops, needed more support, and rates of failure were higher. ADAM and MIDAS realized great gains in building associativity among some of their productive and public works activities, helping communities begin to reconstruct social fabric damaged by conflict, illicit livelihoods, poverty and the absence of the state. The common goals, training, and support were essential, yet took time to build. Notably these successes were also replicated across communities – when projects involved some combination of campesinos, indigenous groups, and Afro-Colombians.\n\nFurthermore,  families and communities embraced licit opportunities to make a living and avoid the social disintegration, risks to life and livelihood, and shadow markets of illicit crops. In terms of scaling up, established enterprises and associations provided fertile ground for productive activities that change mentalities and scope from subsistence, household levels to efficiency, marketing and a regional economy. Given the ambition and global scope of the proposed peace process, working with the GOC at all levels will be essential. The output-level indicators by which ADAM and MIDAS are known – families supported, hectares planted, jobs created – were flawed both for telling the story of the programs and for monitoring their progress to improve implementation.",
      "Key Recommendations": "- Sustainability:\no Leverage positive experiences with current and past community level projects, companies and public works by having them share their experiences in peer-to-peer learning.\no In exit strategies, link producers to networks – peers, as above, but also market actors, government and university technical assistance sources, and financial resources.\n\n- Associativity:\n\no Use genuine participatory methods in bottom-up decision making on productive and public works projects. Build in time for the process, particularly with new associations or groups.\no Diagnose local needs and priorities around associativity, in an inclusive, intergenerational process. This is often promised, but in the rush of implementation it can be compromised.\no Train and monitor implementing staff on inclusivity and respect for self-determination.\n\n- Culture of legality:\no Focus on what beneficiaries need in order to think long-term: credit access, land tenure, education and capacity building options.\no Foster this culture with the same conditions that supported associativity.\n\n- Scaling up:\no Build with experienced associations and companies using the bottom-up, participatory approach to take best advantage of their proven interest and ability to produce.\no Scale projects sufficiently for production and livelihoods that are greater than subsistence level. This goal should supersede attaining output indicators.\no Ensure municipal participation. The peace process should empower municipalities, and their buy-in is a precondition for sustainability and state credibility.\n\n- Monitoring and evaluation:\no Create modern M&E systems for complex environments - adaptive, shorter-cycle, context- and conflict-sensitive, and built around shared stakeholder goals. Avoid privileging output-level results that distort implementation by affecting implementer incentives.\no Work to instill an evaluation culture that permits experimentation in the Mission.\no Manage knowledge intelligently and enlist successful partners to share with others.",

      "Key Findings": "The evaluation concluded that many of the challenges facing CAHW systems are at the level of veterinary governance, and the capacities of government veterinary departments to train, regulate, and supervise CAHWs and other para-professionals, and ensure the quality and reliability of supply of veterinary drugs that reach them.  These challenges commonly relate to the protracted under funding of state veterinary services, and continued grey areas in policy and strategy over the roles of the public and private sectors.",
      "Key Recommendations": "The evaluation’s recommendations focus on organizations.\n- NGOs, OFDA, and USAID projects are requested to keep abreast of and update best practice, to further develop guidance on the use of vouchers in emergency response, and to take advantage of mass communication technologies to keep livestock owners and consumers informed about issues such as food safety.\n\n- Quantitative evidence on the state of the veterinary pharmaceutical trade and drug quality is urgently needed. National veterinary services need to continue to strengthen the institutions that can define and regulate roles, and to support access to quality drugs and vaccines whilst effectively monitoring the development of animal health services. Regional bodies such as the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) have an important role in facilitating the exchange of knowledge and lessons between member states’ veterinary services.\n\n- Emergency and development donors need to continue to collaborate to support effective and legal private CAHW systems during normal periods so that they can operate effectively during emergencies. Emerging resilience frameworks provide a means to coordinate and harmonize these approaches.",

The majority of water quality samples (79%) from protected wells, however, were of unsatisfactory quality in the dry season.  Almost all of the water quality samples from protected wells and RWH systems were unsatisfactory in the rainy season and only 4% of rural water samples were of excellent or satisfactory quality. Regardless of the actual water quality, a high percentage (>93%) of respondents from urban and rural households with RWH systems and protected wells perceived that water was of good quality (i.e. odorless, colorless and good taste) both in the dry and rainy seasons.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Overall Performance and Impact:\n Given that the overall performance (in terms of service levels) is poor, USAID/OFDA should ensure\nits partners conduct all water infrastructure interventions, even in emergencies in a manner that\nconsiders how to provide ongoing services. (Strategic)\n USAID/OFDA should facilitate capacity for a management structure whether it be community-based,\nprivate sector, local government, or a combination. (Tactical)\nEfficiency:\n USAID/OFDA and implementing partners should select the most efficient water supply model for\nthe context using the concepts of the Technology Applicability Framework3. (Strategic)\n Unless implementing partners can provide evidence of a design that works well in rural areas,\nUSAID/OFDA should only consider funding RWH in a peri-urban setting closer to markets for\nparts, artisans for building and rooftops adequate for water collection. (Tactical)\nCoverage and Design:\n USAID/OFDA could address poor functioning systems by funding water supply programs that\nensure full coverage in a defined geographic area (e.g., a suburb, rural village).

      "Key Findings": "In terms of enabling policy and business environment, public-private dialogues (PPDs) were noted as important activities in successfully promoting stakeholder engagement. The several Government of Nepal (GON) ministries involved reported success in ministry coordination, stakeholder engagement, and the effectiveness of NEAT’s project implementation. For food security and four agricultural value chains, the report notes that the 2.5-year duration was too short. Many of the participants wanted a longer program more in line with the original 5-year program that was approved. Many farmers claimed they were just grasping how to implement learned skills when the program ended while there was an increase in lentil production but this was achieved by male farmers. Female farmer's yield actually declined. The sustainability of the NEAT program was hindered by its failure to focus on training local agricultural development officers who could continue NEAT’s work in the future",
      "Key Recommendations": "- Consider splitting large, multi-faceted programs to narrow topic focus and reduce implementation complications. NEAT was a large and diverse program, which could understandably present size-related complications.\n- Ensure stakeholder engagement with all key stakeholders and from the onset of programming. Respondents from the business sector shared their dissatisfaction in not being involved in decision making from the onset, stating that the programs were very government-focused.\n- Encouraging farmers to use new hybrid seeds needs to be carefully considered. Although productive, hybrid seeds usually must be repurchased each year.\n- Access to finance initiatives within similar programs should be included, as these activities empower the farmers to participate in other program interventions, such as training, capacity building, and purchasing of appropriate seeds, among others.",

According to YB‘s theory of change, young people learn to internalize a sense of personal and civic responsibility less via seminars and roundtables than direct, hands-on practice. Through taking on tasks that teach by doing, through contributing to the production of tangible outputs that improve the lives of others, young people gain a sense of personal and collective efficacy that makes them more resilient, persevering and engaged. In the words of one participant,. \"The project has empowered us: if capable and strong young people decide to move and take an action and to influence those who are decision makers, we can make many changes.\" Project experience validated this strategy.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Greater Emphasis on Livelihoods\nRegardless of the many troubling social, political, and cultural issues in BiH, it is clear that young people overwhelmingly need help with employment.\n\nCommunity Asset Building Motivates Young People\nThe activity most highlighted by participants in the evaluation is community asset building. This YELC component engaged and mobilized young people who were idle but seeking a way to\n―plug in to their communities outside of political activity.\n\nBiH Needs a National-Scale Youth Engagement Program\nThe intertwined trends of youth discouragement, youth marginalization, and youth unemployment do not bode well for the future of BiH.

Campaign exposure can be increased with the addition of regional radio networks.\n\n- Uptake of SMS service was low. It is recommended that referral to the SMS platform be given more prominence –possibly even its own dedicated radio and TV spots and/or print materials.\n\n- Since 35.1% of the women who did not give birth at a health facility reported that they could not make it to a hospital in time. Future campaign should also emphasize the importance of moving closer to a health facility, when possible, as one's due date approaches.",

      "Key Findings": "Over the lifespan of TB CARE I-Indonesia, the NTP, with support from GF, USAID and international partners, has made significant strides in expanding universal access to quality TB care in the public sector. There is almost full DOTS coverage at public health center (puskesmas) level, while substantial progress has been made in the engagement of general hospitals (hospital-DOTS linkages): the number of these hospitals implementing good quality DOTS expanded from 127 (2011) to 265 (2014) in TB CARE I-supported areas. The number of TB patients notified by these hospitals increased from 32,708 in 2010 to 54,004 in 2013.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1.a. Expand infection control in public and private sector facilities: Ensure the implementation of TB-IC measures, by including the FAST/TemPO strategy in infection control plans at all service levels, both primary and referral level health facilities, targeting all PMDT, DOTS and TB-ARV sites, prisons and detention centers in collaboration with DG Medical Service, and other related ministries and professional organizations such as PDPI, PERDALIN, etc.\n\n2.a. Expanding universal access to appropriate care and treatment\nProvide assistance to scale up coverage of quality TB care at all health facilities, notably those of private providers, in the following forms: Assist the NTP with further integration of TB services in the National Health Insurance (NHI) system and developing mechanisms to assure provider quality (through credentialing, certification, accreditation, evaluation and clinical audit).\n\n3.a. Strengthening political commitment and leadership\nChallenge TB should intensify efforts to support the NTP in strategic planning, management and operations, and securing commitment and sustainable financial support through national health insurance and local government/partners.",

      "Key Findings": "Ultimately targeting 70,162 beneficiaries at the community, district and provincial levels, API Perubahan strengthened the capacity of local government officials, community members and informal leaders across\nten vulnerable sub-districts (kelurahan) among two provinces in Indonesia: Jawa Tengah and Maluku.\n\nIn these areas, API Perubahan established two Program Advisory Committees (PAC) that formed as the local forum at regency (Kabupaten) level that is concerned with disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation; and four sub-district working groups (SDWGs, or Pokja). The PAC engaged representatives from Kabupaten down to sub-district governments, academia and local NGOs. API Perubahan provided training in the areas of climate analysis; climate change adaptation (CCA) and disaster risk reduction (DRR) for PAC and SDWG members utilizing the training curriculum and modules used by the National Disaster Management Agency (Badan Nasional Penanggulangan Bencana, BNPB) (which was improved by API Perubahan); training on advocacy and local development planning for SDWG; and entrepreneurship training for SDWG and community entrepreneur.",
      "Key Recommendations": "The excellent relationships and engagement with various stakeholders (national and provincial government, technical agencies, NGO, and private) that were built by API Perubahan should be maintained and strengthened by Mercy Corps Indonesia. Other DRR or CCA related projects under Mercy Corps Indonesia could incorporate their activities with engagement with these partners. In addition, SDWGs should clearly state their concrete action plans. Instruments and other knowledge management products should be better adapted to the local context. For the monitoring system, it is important to measure the program achievement by qualitative indicators. ",

      "Key Findings": "There was a general acknowledgement from the CORAF/WECARD Administration and Finance Department that capacities in the department were built and deployed for improved financial\nmanagement and operations of the department. Similarly, it was established that CORAF/WECARD’s human resources were strengthened under the GFSRI and FtF as demonstrated by increased staff numbers (5 paid from FtF funds) and capacity to manage programs, finances, knowledge and M&E (Annex A.1.C).\n\nOverall, the general consensus among beneficiaries and partners is that the USAID-funded IFSP was relevant and contributed to institutional strengthening at both CORAF and the NARS. Out of 9 end-user beneficiaries interviewed, 93% reported that they would be “very interested” in participating in a similar project in the future ((Appendix 5). At CORAF/WECARD, the two Program Managers funded by the IFSP strengthened the CORAF/WECARD Secretariat through their resource mobilization efforts that brought in an estimated $10 million in new project funds in 2011. (CORAF/WECARD Assessment Report, 2011). These new funds enabled the recruitment of additional staff for CORAF/WECARD programs. The scientific, coordinating and advocacy roles played by the Program Managers contributed to leveraging other agricultural and related research and/or development projects in the West Africa region funded by other donors. Examples of those donor-funded initiatives that used resources, outputs and knowledge from the SPS projects were the West Africa Agricultural Productivity (WAAP) and the Yam Improvement for Income and Food Security in West Africa, YIIFSWA, funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.\n\nAt the country level, the project achieved most of its training targets. In Ghana a total of 274 farmers (12.4% females) were trained in the Minisett technology and another 300 (15% females) trained in the yam vine techniques. In Nigeria, Togo and Benin, beneficiaries trained in the Minisett totaled 1,400 (15.7% females), 485 and 170 (34.7% females). In Nigeria the trained farmers trained other farmers, about 3 fold in number. The overhead charges of 2.5% paid to participating NARS was considered too small by most NARS. Directors and some institutions felt that it had a negative impact on project implementation and end user-based Institutions like associations, organizations and NGOs acknowledged how much participation in the SPS projects strengthened their capacity. \n\nThe members of a union of cooperatives in Mali called the USCPCS, who participated in the Striga-Sorghum project credited their successes to capacity strengthening from the project. They celebrated the following exceptional results: nearly 90% of the members of the USCPCS group used improved varieties of sorghum during 2013/14 season, and increased the yield of sorghum from 700 kg/ha (local varieties sorghum) to about 2500 kg / ha (improved varieties) and household income multiplied 5 fold between 2009/2010 and 2013/2014.",
      "Key Recommendations": "CORAF/WECARD should consider shortening the STC processes for project reviews, approvals and validation. They should also adapt flexible procedures and steps to accommodate situations where time\nis of the essence.\n\nUSAID and CORAF/WECARD should consider making adequate budget\nallocations that cater for effective field level project implementation and monitoring required by NARS institutions targeted to participate in the upcoming Feed the Future projects.\n\nThe evaluation team recommends that CORAF/WECARD honors previous agreements made in Memoranda of Agreement with NARS regarding payments of overheads. The evaluation team recommends that CORAF/WECARD makes budget provisions that will allow the\npayment of at least a 10% overhead to NARS institutions implementing USAID-funded projects.\n\nCORAF/WECARD should better articulate the definitions of indicators and targets in their M&E frameworks and ensure NARS are familiar with the elements of the Log frames, including the methodology for  establishing credible baselines. CORAF/WECARD should organize a series of training courses for the M&E staff of the NARS. The training courses should include current and prospective project coordinators.\n\nCORAF/WECARD should standardize report formats for various categories projects. . These standardized formats should be shared and used by the NARS that are participating in the project.\n",

Other programs, like the International Finance Corporation's (IFC) Sustainable Energy Facility (SEF), target commercial banks and provide technical assistance and finance. PFAN is focused on providing services to the project developer community to facilitate and increase CE investment.\n\nPFAN is expected to meet or exceed all performance targets and compares favorably with similar projects and programs designed to address barriers to CE investment. To date, 49 projects are estimated to have reached financial closure, meaning they have been matched with and funded by a financial institution, raising a total of $561.5 million.",
      "Key Recommendations": "USAID should consider funding expanded PFAN data collection and monitoring and evaluation. This would allow PFAN to develop an appropriate performance monitoring plan, collect data including during\nclosure proper, conduct routine exit surveys, and evaluate key areas of difficulty including procedures.\n\nAssuming both of PFAN's dual objectives of broadening access and increasing projects financed in the developing context remain relevant, USAID may wish to consider revising or adding indicators in the future that focus on broadening access.\n\nPFAN should consider first addressing the remaining barriers within the clean energy business area such as addressing negotiations and assistance for financial closure to reduce time to closure and improve\nreliability of data.",

      "Key Findings": "FBP exceeded all of its targets with 64 percent (target 60 percent) of clinically malnourished PLHIV including PMTCT and OVC clients graduating from the activity, and 0.8 percent (target < 5 percent) of PLHIV (including PMTCT and OVC clients) who died during the course of treatment. The report also notes that M&E Plan data indicates FBP met its targets for data and number of reports shared with government and partners, and for the percentage of facilities and distribution outlets collecting and reporting data to FBP. Yet FBP underperformed on the number of health facilities handed over to government. Also, there has been no emphasis on counseling for dietary diversification or increasing micronutrient intake using the locally available sources. To conclude, we found no evidence that gender-related issues were examined, flagged or tracked over time. \n\n\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "Sustain and Scale-up: Based on the successes evidenced in this evaluation, USAID should continue to support the scale-up and integration with other nutritional outreach efforts, while working with the GOE to explore other options for subsidizing supplemental foods. The ES component lacks sufficient evidence of effectiveness to be scaled-up.\n\nWork jointly to assure routine nutrition assessment and counseling: The FMoH and HAPCO should work closely with RHBs, USAID’s Food and Nutrition Technical Assistance (USAID/FANTA III), World Food Programme (WFP) and other stakeholders working in nutrition and HIV/AIDS, to ensure that all health facilities routinely carry out nutritional assessment and counseling. \n\nInclude NACS in ART training: USAID and FMoH should assure the inclusion of NACS into the standard ART training, with appropriate indicators to ensure that every health worker trained on ART is also trained on NACS. Over the long-term, the FMoH, HAPCO, and USAID/FANTA III need to consider integration of NACS into the pre-service curriculum of health science colleges and medical schools.\n",

      "Key Recommendations": "The evaluation team made a number of recommendations to improve the reach, coverage and effectiveness of BIPAI’s capacity-building efforts through a cascading training-of-trainers approach and improvements in its outreach activities and monitoring and evaluation (M&E) methods. Additional recommendations include strengthening the undergraduate and post-graduate training programs in the fields of medicine, nursing, pharmaceutical practice and laboratory science. The team’s overarching recommendation is for the continuation, expansion\nand/or transition of the BIPAI program in support of the MoHSW’s efforts in pediatric HIV/AIDS.",

      "Key Findings": "1. DIALOGUE was praised by all stakeholders interviewed by the ET for changing and creating a more positive environment for local governments. DIALOGUE’s templates and website designs have helped several local governments conduct opinion polls and surveys, and share budget information and performance indicators on the city website. \n\n2. Dialogue Day was consistently cited as being the most effective strategy for establishing working relationships with state officials, primarily with the Cabinet of Ministers and relevant state agencies.\n\n3. Both DIALOGUE and KIs in other development assistance programs mentioned using each other’s website to showcase their own work and best practices, and to include links to their own projects; case studies and lessons learned are also presented in each other’s workshops and seminars.\n\n4. DIALOGUE has promoted principles of transparency and openness among local governments by encouraging member cities to have a website to provide information on the budget, mayor’s policy initiatives, and other pertinent information, and providing website templates for smaller member cities and villages.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. Legislative drafting should be continued and strengthened, as many new laws and by-laws would need to be prepared and cleared through the Cabinet of Ministers and the\nParliament.\n\n2. Continue support to hold Dialogue Day with Government of Ukraine (GoU). Also consider organizing and holding them on a more frequent basis, such as twice a year or as needed. Explore organizing and holding a Dialogue Day with Parliament, as part of the annual AUC municipal conventions (this is already scheduled for 2015).\n\n3. Similar to a donor coordination meeting, a quarterly or semi-annual meeting of donor funded projects could be very useful in sharing lessons learned and creating synergies for\ngreater collaboration. Keeping an active and updated record of past success stories and achievements can also help in quickly getting access to past analytical studies/guides and\nupdating them rather than having to “reinvent the wheel.”\n\n4. Increasing public support for local government reform is one of DIALOGUE’s objectives. However, the project has not chosen – at least thus far - to achieve this objective by\nencouraging and assisting local governments to focus on improvements in service delivery. Citizens’ support and trust in their government usually flows from the ability of the\ngovernment to be responsive to citizen’s needs and priorities. A focus on concrete, achievable results and service improvements within the budget, based on citizen feedback is\nan important step to achieve public support for reform.",

      "Key Findings": "• Overall, the evaluation team heard from central and county governmental partners that RBHS’s capacity-building work was highly valued, and they could point to improvements in how systems were working or to new capacities that had been built.\n\n• While the written project goals, objectives and targets were not specific to decentralization, the project did work to build capacities in counties to assume new functions related to deconcentration in\nsupport of the Government of Liberia’s long-term goal of decentralization.\n\n• RBHS and partners were well placed given their presence in counties with outbreaks and the collaborative relationship with the MOHSW, and thus they were able to make significant contributions to the response.\n\n• In the first phase of RBHS, a key component of the RBHS program focused on provision of direct support for delivery of primary and secondary health services, implemented through performance-based sub-contracts with NGOs.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Capacity-building approaches: As noted by several informants from the central and county levels, and recommended by the evaluation team, all capacity-building activities require: (a) clear, specific and time-bound objectives, and if technical assistance, terms of reference; (b) technical advisors, trainers or coaches with expertise, relevant experience and skills in knowledge transfer and teaming; (c) clear benchmarks; and (d) careful monitoring of performance by the project/donor.\n\nDeconcentration/Decentralization: Supporting accelerated  deconcentration of management of essential health care services and public health functions from the MOHSW to county and district health teams will require a systems approach, strengthening MOHSW functions and skills of personnel to carry out their oversight role and monitoring responsibilities while supporting county government as it assumes increasing responsibilities.\n\nEbola Response: The Ebola crisis has brought to the forefront the need for much stronger disease (and injury) prevention and control. It is recommended that USAID work in partnership with other key\ninternational agencies to provide technical assistance and capacity-building to develop a Public Health Service, within which community health, social mobilization, environmental health and health promotion functions are contained in addition to disease surveillance and outbreak/epidemic management to carry out the essential governmental public health services.",

      "Key Findings": "Overall, the team found the two programs to be effective and successful, with well-organized management systems. This is an especially noteworthy accomplishment given the extremely difficult working conditions in Burkina Faso over the last two to three years. There is, however, room for improvement in any program. There exist cross cutting themes that, if properly addressed, will make the extension of the programs more successful. Many of the evaluators’ observations had previously been made by program staff and discussed in several planning meetings and documents prior to this evaluation.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1) In order to build resilient communities, a comprehensive approach is needed that combines risk reduction activities (infrastructure, appropriate seeds and tools, livestock protection activities, etc.), early warning and disaster response, and livelihood recovery. Take the time to build consensus: Develop dialogue and accountability mechanisms between key local actors, such as government, customary institutions, civil society associations, and the private sector.\n\n2) The extension phase of the programs should focus on interventions that will contribute to the pursuit of good governance, which needs to be a high priority strategy involving the building of both formal and informal institutions and relationships and implemented at the state, community and household levels. However, the community level is a particularly critical level at which to build resilience. The most vulnerable must be helped, in particular, by communities and institutions such as VDCs, PTAs, and WUAs.\n\n3) Although some cultural, social and economic constraints do remain, FASO and ViM must intensify their efforts to increase the leadership role that women play in their professional lives and in their communities.",

SF facilities are located in 39 of the 47 counties in Kenya, representing an 82% reach.\nFinally, it was also noted that demand increased from year-to-year in the number of individuals receiving services from SF facilities related to the four targeted health elements; HIV/AIDS (e.g. HIV Testing and Counseling met 150% of its target), family planning and reproductive health (met 78% of the target), malaria (met 81% of its target), and treatment of diarrhea in children under five (51% of the target).",
      "Key Recommendations": "• Include an enabling environment component in future programs to assess the framework affecting the expansion of health insurance coverage and risk pooling, and advocate for changes;\n• Create stakeholder groups to develop a harmonized, acceptable accreditation framework for use in scaling-up the implementation of quality standards in SF facilities;\n• In order to accurately compute the required level of subsidy, reporting and forecasting should incorporate all costs related to the products including overheads, marketing and distribution costs;\n• Concentrate on expanding the franchised network presence to cover marginalized counties in Kenya;\n• Design indicators and establish targets to improve performance in equity, a key component of the sustainability model.",

      "Key Findings": "The analysis of project documents and interviews with 10 KIs showed that the project used three main ways to address gender issues during both the design and implementation of its activities: 1) included gender in annual work plans; 2) initiated the external assessment of the level of gender integration within P3DP activities; and 3) addressed about half of assessment recommendations in project activities. A full scope of actual effects of pilot PPPs had not materialized yet by the time of evaluation, given that only two pilot projects were launched and were on the early stages of implementation. The survey and KIIs revealed positive expectations associated with pilot PPPs and with municipal PPPs in general. For each expected pilot PPP that could have an effect on reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, P3DP ordered, during feasibility studies, a special technical study aimed at estimating an expected impact of a suggested technical solution (e.g. a new boiler in Malyn) on the emissions. P3DP’s assistance on preparation and launch of pilot PPPs is generally well appreciated by the participants, with a few technical caveats",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. (Future programming). Taking into consideration the complexity of PPP projects, it is suggested for the implementing entity to consider including a position of a part-time local gender specialist.\n\n2. (Future programming). If another project that supports municipal PPPs is funded, its design and work plan must require much earlier launches of PPPs than happened at P3DP. In particular, the PPP pipeline should not be postponed to the last year.\n\n3. (Current project). Make a focused and urgent effort to radically simplify a PPP preparation and procurement process. \n\n4. (Current project). If the task under Recommendation 3 is implemented successfully, follow up by developing a package of model documents that would specify the concept of the\nsimplified process.\n\n5. (Future programming). If another project of supporting municipal PPPs is funded, it should consider diversifying further the regulatory and procedural approaches to PPPs, compared to “quick fixes” considered and developed within P3DP, under Recommendation 3 & 4.",

      "Document Title": "Final Evaluation of the Sustainable Conservation Approaches in Priority Ecosystems Program (SCAPES)",
      "Key Findings": "The four key principles were already well integrated into the standard procedures of almost all major conservation-based implementing partners, but SCAPES annual meetings and other learning activities have helped develop and refine these concepts. The SCAPES program was designed during a period in USAID management when gender considerations did not have the prominence that they have today. Evaluators conducted and analyzed the fourth LFA carried out during SCAPES. Each theory of change identified common actions, intermediate results, threats, and biodiversity targets across SCAPES and provided a framework evaluators used to assess outcomes of seven major conservation strategies, such as land protection, law enforcement, and climate change.",
      "Key Recommendations": "• Establish a reasonably sized landscape to support in light of threats and opportunities; the boundaries of the landscape (physical, governmental, biodiversity, ethnic) should be defined in the context of funding limitations.\n• Ascertain if a transboundary cooperation component is needed to effectively address certain threats.\n\n• Set a reasonable duration for USAID support. Despite typical USAID procurement limits of five years or less, several USAID programs have been authorized for longer periods, such as 20 years for both Integrated Conservation of the Andean Amazon and the Central Africa Regional Program for the Environment in with five-year phases.\n\n• Prioritize a limited number of problems to address in the context of the comparative advantages of USAID and its implementing partners.\n\n• Carefully discuss how best to partner with other non–USAID-funded organizations working in the landscape and reduce duplicate multiple-donor reporting requirements.",

      "Key Findings": "INVC has introduced technologies and practices related to land preparation, crop management, harvest and post-harvest practices, and storage and marketing for groundnuts and soybeans. INVC did not report yield data in fiscal year (FY) 2013, but in FY2014 it reported groundnut yields of 0.87 metric tons/ha (MT/ha) and soybean yields of 0.67 MT/ha— 7 percent and 11 percent below their respective baseline levels of 0.93 MT/ha and 0.75 MT/ha.\n\nThe Consortium has supported collective marketing options for farmers predominantly through ACE, giving them leverage in negotiating for their crops by providing them with market intelligence. The INVC BCC Strategy on Nutrition and Agriculture Value Chains in Malawi is implemented through Farmers Clubs and the Community Care Group (CCG) Model. INVC has implemented an LCD component to help its partners better implement the project and prepare to become direct USAID awardees.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Assess legume cultivation in the ZOI. USAID should follow up on the ongoing University of North Carolina impact evaluation of INVC to assess groundnut and soybean cultivation in the ZOI. Farmers who did not grow these crops prior to INVC should be surveyed to assess their ongoing cultivation to determine if\nthey grew these crops only during INVC implementation or if they permanently adopted them in their portfolio.\n\nTap the potential of women. The Consortium and sub-partners should emphasize reaching out to women farmers as innovators and early adopters.\n\nContinue to distribute high-quality seeds. NASFAM\nand CADECOM should continue to distribute high-quality groundnut and soybean seeds as an incentive to introduce farmers to improved varieties. Distribution should continue each season throughout the life of the project.\n\nContinue intercropping training. AFOs should continue to train farmers in the benefits of intercropping. This training should make clear that it is acceptable to mix crops and that pigeon peas will not compete with the primary crop (i.e., groundnuts or soybeans). For farmers who have already learned about\nintercropping, reinforcement training should be conducted so any misunderstandings, such as crops conflicting with each other, are clarified.\n\nNew approaches to pest/weed management. Because so many farmers interviewed cannot afford to purchase pesticides and herbicides, emphasis should be placed elsewhere regarding pest/weed management.\n",

It also sought to align itself with changes in the education sector’s political and institutional context, which required programmatic changes that could not keep pace with the changes in the context. However, the program design did not account for the opportunities and threats posed by the implementation context, nor did it have the capacity to manage these risks as they arose. SUMA also carried out a pedagogical model with a package of methodological tools (classroom / school / community) appropriate for rural multi-grade schools, which contributed to the policy of quality and equitable education. Lastly, at the district area level, SUMA developed a local governance model that put into practice what education policy proposed in terms of a decentralized management model oriented towards the achievement of learning.",
      "Key Recommendations": " During the strategic planning for a policy and regulatory reform intervention, identify and plan to monitor all critical assumptions and risks; for implementation, identify a flexible management\napproach that allows regular adaptations to an evolving environment.\n Improve monitoring of the intervention, defining hierarchical and articulated results, and designing indicators to measure processes, outputs and outcomes.\n Ensure that the project timeframe is sufficient to allow for the completion of the different project phases, budgeting time for adjustments as reasonable.\n Include a gender focus on interventions that seek to improve learning, given the differences measured between boys and girls in the results of the national learning achievement test.\n Link primary education with pre-primary education based on the evidence that early childhood stimulation contributes to reading and writing during the initial years of primary school.",

Regular workplace visits by RD staff during the course of the internship for support and monitoring helped interns to ensure the successful implementation of their individual work plans. These visits also allowed for more regular dialogue and additional feedback opportunities for host employers and interns. Moreover, supporting interns to set and achieve clear goals during the foundational training allowed them to focus on job activities aligned with their goals, increasing job satisfaction and performance. The overall employment rate for participants – 78 percent - compares favorably with the official employment rate of approximately 65 percent for all labor force participants with tertiary degrees.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Effectiveness & Impact\n Work closely with human resource departments of the partner organizations so as to en-\nsure that the graduates who qualify for placement are matched with the skills needed by the potential employers. This will enhance the workplace environment and increase\nchances of interns transitioning to full-time employment after their internship placement period.\n Allow the intern to determine his/her placement while taking into consideration the matching educational background (skills) with the needs of the employers. This increases the possibility that after the placement period, the interns will transition into fulltime employment with the host employer. The interns will also be placed in an area which is in line with their training (educational background), thus enabling them to acquire relevant skills and experience.\n\nSustainability & Scalability\n Continue to contribute to policy development relating to the national volunteer programs\nand Youth Venture Capital Fund. While UIP has encouraged government engagement in the program, continued engagement with the government is essential to realizing a na-\ntional policy.\n Alternative and diverse sources of funding, besides donor funding, need to be sourced to sustain the internship program. Looking to local sources of funding, private and public, will increase the chances of securing funds for the program.",

      "Key Recommendations": "USAID should design the next project to incorporate a much closer link between the social marketing, service delivery and social and behavior change communications (SBCC) projects. In addition, the link with any project working on procurement and supply chain, including capacity building, should be clearly spelled out. The creation of demand through SBCC, the social marketing of related products and the public supply of products needed once demand is created are all interconnected and critical to results and impact.",

      "Document Title": "Local Governance Decentralization Program (LOGODEP) Final Performance Evaluation ",
      "Key Findings": "LOGODEP achieved its objectives in an integrated, holistic manner. It took into account local culture, traditions, and power dynamics and helped create a sense of ownership. It is one of the rare local governance programs in Ghana to have national impact. Its two great achievements are the Presidential Directive on Street Naming and adding spatial planning into medium-term development plan guidance. LOGODEP did an excellent job of building district capacity to use satellite maps and GIS for participatory planning. By knowing where projects are planned, the use of digitized GIS maps can build responsiveness, equity, and accountability and facilitate private investment. The central government’s failure to provide equipment, high-quality satellite maps, and GIS training to MMDAs outside of the Western Region has prevented most MMDAs from implementing the medium-term development plan (MTDP) guidance fully.\n\nWhile it is too early to assess the full impact on IGF, IGF revenue increased in all five target districts and is expected to increase further in 2015. The LOGODEP approach is very cost-effective, as the system will generate enough revenue to cover the cost of the system by 2017. This result contributes to the attractiveness of this model for replication nationwide. The central government oversaw spatial planning and street naming in a manner that may alienate MMDAs. Only 4% of MMDAs, mainly LOGODEP’s target districts, completed the street naming process by January 2015. The unrealistic deadline and poor resource planning contributed to refusal by some MMDAs to implement the directive. By requiring MMDAs to expend their own funds without creating a sense of ownership, the central government showed that it is not yet fully committed to decentralization. \n\nAs such, political will for fiscal decentralization in particular at the highest levels is weak. LOGODEP’s National Linkages Manager has enabled the Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development (MLGRD) to support the street naming initiative nationwide. When LOGODEP closes, his departure will make it difficult for the Ministry to maintain its support. Canada may second an IGF technical assistant to the MLGRD. For most MMDAs, public-private partnerships (PPPs) are not yet a feasible option to increase resources and development impact. The decision to extend LOGODEP by two years has paid off. Three years was inadequate for the program, to achieve its objectives, and the two extra years gave it the time needed to have nationwide impact. \n",
      "Key Recommendations": "RECOMMENDATIONS\n Allow LOGODEP to end with no additional funding. Before it ends, focus on consolidating gains and\nensuring sustainability of program results. If elections are held, provide additional assistance to fe-\nmale candidates. Initiate a wide-ranging communications campaign, engaging stakeholders at the na-\ntional, regional, and district levels, as well as other donors, to highlight program accomplishments\nand build demand for follow-on program. Install dlREV in remaining districts and build capacity to\nuse it effectively. Continue to integrate dlREV into the Ghana Integrated Financial Management Sys-\ntem (GIFMIS). Continue to support IGF collection, facilitate IGF performance reviews, and bolster\naudit capacity. \n Consider a follow-on project that replicates the LOGODEP approach elsewhere in Ghana, including:\nsocial accountability; citizen education; tax enforcement; audit strengthening; sub-district strengthen-\ning; community radio capacity building; collaboration with traditional authorities; CSO grants; inte-\ngrating dlREV and GIFMIS; improving MTDP guidance and increasing central funding; helping re-\nsolve problems of technical ministry decentralization; and addressing MMDA land valuation for IGF collection.",

Project objectives should be in line with national policy and development goals.\n• Engage stakeholders early in the planning and development process and seek local champions to take ownership of the project to facilitate sustainability.\n",

      "Key Recommendations": "1. Separate direct and indirect FTEs and report them as they are.\n\n2. Resolve the existing embargo on the Central Bank to open the way for FAIDA and other US government projects to intervene effectively in supporting regulations that would create an enabling environment for a progressive and thriving financial sector.\n\n3. Endeavor to identify more businesswomen and assist them through the process of preparing their loan applications and documentation.\n\n4. Allow MNOs to lead the expansion of Mobile Money services based on their best business practices.\n\n5. Broaden the range of participants invited to matchmaking events and avoid recycling same people in these functions/events.",

      "Key Recommendations": "1. If JAFPP sustainability is a priority for USAID, a Project Implementation Letter (PIL) or Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) stating this agreement should be signed with JAFPP. \n2. Assistance to JAFPP should focus on clinic decentralization and facilitating clinics to operate as individual business units (profit centers).\n3. Financial assistance to JAFPP should be predicated on meeting performance targets, and funding should be provided in tranches conditional upon meeting benchmarks such as cost recovery targets. \n4. USAID should support market research to determine whether JAFPP could increase cost recovery and its client base by offering a wider range of medical services for families as a one- stop shop for all maternal and child health needs.",

      "Key Findings": "The Women’s Leadership Program in Paraguay not only designed and implemented relevant initiatives, it influenced the ways the academic units within UNA-FCA are managed, by engaging faculty and administrators in the design of new policies, creating new courses, and breaking some of the boundaries between the\nuniversity and civil society organizations.\n\nThe management system employed by the WLPP team allowed for synergies to emerge within the UNA-FCA.\n\nOne of the greatest achievements of UF-UNA/FCA partnership was the curricular revision of the five disciplines that make up the academic programs of the college of agricultural sciences.\n\nOne of the pillars of the gender mainstreaming process, occurring at UNA/FCA, was the training provided by the team from the University of Florida to the WLPP team, FCA faculty and other invited guests.\n\nThe program staff contributed in many forms to the success of the Center for Leadership—with the design and delivery of the gender and leadership workshops, recruitment and selection of mentors, matching of students and internship sites, etc.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. Implement gender policies with support from public and private partnerships.\n2. Build UNA/FCA capacity to integrate gender in the curriculum.\n3. Improve the effectiveness of program areas related to gender and leadership training, and engagement of agricultural school directors, teachers, NGO staff, and UNA/FCA faculty in the promotion of gender equity and institutionalization of gender education.\n4.

To retain the collaborative elements and partnerships, he believed that the district could play a pivotal role in initiating the meetings to plan and design the ongoing initiatives and determine the leadership and management oversight of these community mechanisms. The district letterhead, he remarked, would bring the profile and value for planning the sustainability initiatives. The mobile phone alerts through RapidSMS linking CHWs to nearby facilities for referral and real time information systems, needs to be sustained and integrated into the ongoing district health information system architecture.",

Most of the grantees have not systematically monitored the income of the enterprises obtaining access to their financial services or to those of supported financial institutions. The grantee reporting and the project supervision reports presented by IFC contain hardly any information on sales growth or on job creation. The dearth of data is partly a result of the fact that, in spite of the importance of the employment aspect as stated in several Challenge documents, only two Grant Agreements included targets for employment growth. Both of these projects failed to achieve their job creation target. Although not explicitly mentioned in the list of Challenge objectives, some projects adopted a triple bottom line approach and try to achieve social and environmental goals.",

The project has established a strong partnership with local agencies for the implementation of its activities at the local level and has collaborated with international agencies for disseminating lessons learned to the national level. It is also too early to quantify the impact of the project intervention on environmental degradation, but the intervention is potentially rehabilitating degraded forestland. Advanced seedling production techniques will likely remain in the country, as seedlings produced by advanced techniques are recognized as well adapted and as having high survival rates. And lastly,  LRI reforestation and forest protection initiatives enhanced interaction and support between diverse communities and groups around a common issue.",
      "Key Recommendations": "• Selecting reforestation sites by means of participatory land-use planning will enhance the sustainability of plantations and enhance plantation habitat connectivity. \n• Any opportunities to reduce the cost of setting up a plantation should be utilized, and potentially low-cost sites should be given priority for reforestation. .\n• Any opportunities to increase the survival rate of planted trees should be utilized. \n• Assessment and establishment of green firebreaks will contribute to fire prevention in the long term.\n",

There is some evidence of integration between HIV services and other services such as TB and family planning, however, this practice is far from universal.  \n\n• Second to HIV-related services, MNCH has been a program area for which positive trends are observed, with carryover benefits to PMTCT efforts. \n\n• The level of effort for MNCH and FP was particularly high for APHIAPlus Central/Eastern. \n\n• Traditional birth assistants continue to play a very prominent role in\ndelivery assistance, particularly in Western Kenya and Rift Valley. ",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. In designing future activities, narrow the technical scope for Result 3 (“increased use of quality health services, products and information”) and Result 4 (“social determinants of health”) to concentrate on maximizing synergies between the two work streams.\n2. For sustainability purposes, give strong consideration to positioning OVC efforts within the framework of “child protection” or “child-friendly social welfare.”\n3. Position future USAID-funded efforts addressing the social determinants of health as a platform that integrates health and social protection.\n4.

      "Key Findings": "Component 1: Efficient Use of On-Farm Water\n• By reducing loss due to seepage and increasing water flow rates, improved channels and tertiary watercourses have unquestionably increased the availability of irrigation water.\n• Factors largely outside of AKF/AKRSP’s control affected their ability to meet project objectives for irrigating 15,500 acres of land.\n• Work on tertiary watercourses progressed more slowly than anticipated largely due to the need for a much more intensive master planning exercise than originally anticipated and delays developing a grants manual and environmental documentation while USAID and AKF ironed out details of the cooperative agreement.\n\nComponent 2: Enhancing Productivity of High-Value Horticulture and Dairy Products\n• A large majority of beneficiaries attributed project interventions with increasing the quantities of agricultural and livestock products they produced and sold.\n\nComponent 3: Enhancing Processing and Marketing Capacity\n• AKRSP’s training in post-harvest practices seems to have been particularly effective in raising awareness of the value of proper grading, storage, and packaging practices.\n• Other than the Friday bazaar, which has been a particularly effective innovation for linking producers directly to consumers, AKRSP did not seem to focus much on linking producers to alternative markets.\n\nComponent 4: Creating an Enabling Environment for the Agricultural Sector to Grow\n• The enabling environment component has progressed slowly, largely because it has been difficult to engage policy makers and stakeholders.\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. If AKF/AKRSP continues the irrigation infrastructure work, it needs to communicate better with affected communities and engage them more fully in planning.\n2. In future support to irrigation schemes, USAID must thoroughly understand the structure of traditional water rights and incorporate these rights in design and implementation from the start.\n3. To enhance prospects for sustainability, AKF/AKRSP should focus on building sustainable public or private sector technical service providers who can support greenhouses, orchards, nurseries, processing, and marketing.",

      "Key Findings": "Through extensive personal interviews, focus group discussions and a nationally representative survey organized around society's changing perceptions of corruption conducted in 9 parishes, this evaluation found strong internal evidence that USAID’s Project has succeeded in raising Jamaican awareness and fostering a national dialogue around corruption and integrity issues. It played a critically important role in fostering political transparency through the advocacy efforts of the Jamaican NGO implementing it – National Integrity Action (NIA) through recently enacted political party registration and campaign finance regulation legislation. Internationally, Transparency International‘s decision to make NIA the country’s official TI country chapter, selecting its Executive Director to serve on the team which developed TI’s new Strategy 2020 – serves as recognition of its ability to replicate its approach throughout the Caribbean.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Adapting the Project’s targeted outreach to schools, communities, churches, universities and youth groups, especially at-risk youth, would also help to recruit and train the next generation of anti- corruption champions. As specific legislative outcomes emerge from current debates, USAID is also encouraged to partner with other IDPs to supplement the approach of a future Jamaican project with technical assistance to address continued roadblocks in the political and justice spheres.",

      "Key Recommendations": "1. Leveraging its success, USAID should continue to facilitate importing and transporting liquefied natural gas.\n\n2. To support overhauling transmission networks, USAID should encourage and support implementation of the technical audits undertaken during EPP.\n\n3. USAID should consider supporting work on gas-related policies and agreements, subsidy targeting, amendments to the Electricity Act, and policies supporting improvements in DISCOs’ commercial operations.",

      "Key Findings": "Some colleagues saw a role for USAID in advising local firms on how to make Corporate Social Responsibility approaches more strategic. Others saw value in encouraging local firms to consider more shared value approaches. “We want thought leaders in the local private sector,” said one colleague. Another added, “Our effort to engage [local companies] is a very significant opportunity to encourage them to be globally responsible.” USAID practitioners can draw upon a wealth of LPSP knowledge and experience that exists across the Agency. Although this paper is a first assessment and identifies emerging trends, Agency colleagues can explore multiple models and approaches that have been successful in a variety of contexts. Interviews identified how Missions are engaging local partners, through focusing on strong relationships, mapping the local private sector, and using annual program statements. Although the due diligence process for local partners can be challenging, many colleagues are drawing on local networks to assess partnering risk. Finally, Mission colleagues have found success in technical approaches such as embedding local partners into existing USAID activities, utilizing procurement instruments that would allow relatively small co-investments, asking implementing partners to manage local company relationships, and linking technical assistance to local partnerships.",
      "Key Recommendations": "USAID Program Implementation and Design\n1. The team recommends that any future USAID C-LRA activity develop and implement a clear sustainability strategy for building the capacity of community structures to continue managing, maintaining, and operating ICT for community-based protection and EWS (and in particular the FM radios and HF radios).\n\nManagement:\n1. The team recommends USAID initiate an analysis on how to better implement community-based conflict recovery programs and activities as contributing and enabling parts of an overarching (but integrated) set of USG and USAID goals in the region.\n\nCoordination\n1. The team recommends that USAID consider a conceptualization of its C-LRA activities that more clearly delineates and de-conflicts competing or redundant programming between Invisible Children and USAID’s C-LRA programming.\n\nPerformance Monitoring\n1. The team recommends that any future refinement and redevelopment of USAID C-LRA activities include a rigorous, yet operationally flexible and responsive, monitoring and evaluation plan.\n\nStrategic Considerations\n1. At its heart, the LRA problem is nested within much broader security and development issues. Therefore any solution to this problem will require a more holistic, multi-sector approach.",

The reasons that keep the users from changing energy sources are mainly the risks of explosion and funding. It is therefore recommended a second phase to build on the base of the project. This would be the opportunity to strengthen the media campaign with clear messages about the security measures and benefits of LPG. The communication on the safety aspects must be strengthened in order to dispel the fear that usually draws its origin from the lack of information. Messages should be clear and compelling as well to carry people to action.\n\n3. A team of technicians must be set up to reconcile and contextualize the various draft bills written until now. The bill must cover all aspects of the industry from importation, storage, transportation and sale. The bill must take into account the various components of the industry such as fire and safety, municipalities, TPTC, MDE, MCI, Ministry of Finances, BME, private sector representatives, etc.",

      "Key Findings": "Farmers were linked to supermarkets and in 2013 and 2014 the two main supermarkets purchased $278,000 and $373,000 worth of vegetables from DAC supported farmers, with an increase in value of 34% between 2013 and 20141. From our beneficiary survey, farmers reported an average weekly income of $70 from the sale of vegetables, selling on average for 46 weeks in the years. Median income was $50; there was a large variation in income per beneficiary with 86% of farmers earning less than $2,700 per year ($60 per week). The more diligent and committed farmers earned higher incomes. This income data was supported by project data which suggests that farmers’ sales to Kmanek (the largest supermarket buyer) were on average around $1,000 in 2014.",
      "Key Recommendations": "If intending to support the commercialization of agriculture, projects should focus more on more commercially minded farmers and in strategic locations.\n\nProjects should also focus on producing crops that have some chance of being competitive in international markets because the domestic market is unable to absorb substantial amounts of additional production.\n\nFocusing on more commercially minded farmers in strategic locations will also make projects more cost effective, make logistics easier, and will have more chance of sustainability.\n\nThe DAC training model was a good one and should be adopted by other projects.\n\nThere is a need for better financial and economic analysis of enterprises, and across the value chain, so that donors, projects and the Government of Timor-Leste can make good investment decisions and promote the crops that have a sustainable market potential.",

      "Key Findings": "The TK Project has been well designed to meet the needs of OVCs and their families and has taken services too hard to reach areas. However, the demand for services has not been met as there are vulnerable areas, and particular sub-groups of OVCs (e.g. children on farms and streets) that are still not being reached. The CFC approach is a holistic model of care that facilitates the provision of a range of services to meet the needs of the family. The key strengths of this approach are the identification of vulnerable households and service provision at household level.",
      "Key Recommendations": "• There needs to be a purposeful effort by future grantees, IPs and the GoB to target children with disabilities, children on farms, children on streets and children who have dropped out of school in future OVC programmes.\n• Programme strategies for including men and boys need to be implemented or strengthened by future grantees, IPs and the GoB where they do exist.\n• The GROW model demonstrates a lot of potential and can be strengthened through consolidating linkages with existing government economic and livelihood programmes; the selection of appropriate IGAs; and better mentoring support for IGAs.\n• The Aflateen programme must be adapted by grantees to ensure that the content is relevant to the needs and interests of the youth.\n• For programmes such as the YEP, grantees should ensure that linkages with appropriate government and private sector youth empowerment interventions.\n`",

      "Key Recommendations": "1. When engaging in a capacity building program make sure that it follows a well-designed structured process, with milestones that are time bound, that progress on the OD components is incentivized, and where the various capacity building tools are better structured.\n\n2. It is recommended that extensive consultation and facilitation take place to ensure local buy-in into new programming direction.\n\n3. BOCONGO must enter into an agreement with the NGO council regarding its role and functions relative to the council—in particular its capacity building function for civil society.",

      "Key Findings": "• ASF’s design of TAP was generally sound, i.e., it planned relevant and effective interventions. \n• It also implemented most activities reasonably well after the mid-term course correction. \n• Its primary implementation failings stemmed from a very long start-up period which delayed substantive engagement with many beneficiaries by two or three years.\n• The late start deprived beneficiaries of the time necessary to gain experience with new technologies and practices before project support ends and may ultimately compromise the sustainability of results.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. If and when USAID/Pakistan engages local partners, it should do so slowly with relatively modest projects where the negative consequences associated with up front learning are small.\n\n2. USAID/Pakistan should adapt the value of exports indicator to reflect a more meaningful measure of enhanced access to export markets.\n\n3. If USAID/Pakistan intends to continue supporting agricultural value chain development, it should consider continuing support to at least some of the more promising TAP-supported value chains and beneficiaries to give beneficiaries the additional technical assistance necessary to cement the lessons they have learned and address new challenges that arise as they gain experience with new technologies and practices.\n\n4. If USAID/Pakistan wishes to continue supporting the meat sector with a focus on developing export markets, it needs to take a more holistic approach.\n\n5. To improve prospects for sustainability, USAID/Pakistan should require implementing partners to develop sustainability plans during the design phase, review the plans periodically to determine whether sustainability hypotheses are valid, and adapt implementation as necessary if the hypotheses do not hold true.\n6. When building and/or strengthening institutions is an important component of a sustainability strategy, it needs to start early in the project so the institutions are engaged, strong, and sustainable.",

      "Key Findings": "While service delivery was found to have improved at the TSHIP-supported sites visited by the Evaluation Team, TSHIP was seriously hindered in achieving its expected health outcomes during the six years of the project because the project’s critical assumptions failed to hold during implementation and because some indicators require longer timelines to see an improvement.  Also, while TSHIP ushered in new progressive health policies such as minimum coverage packages, they are still at too early a stage of implementation to be evaluated and to have delivered measurable health outcomes.   The assumptions which have thus far been hard for the Government of Nigeria (GON) and LGAs to meet included the ability and willingness of the two states to provide adequate staff levels at the state, local government, and health facility levels; provide sufficient funding levels for high-quality service delivery; provide adequate commodities; and a functioning health management information system (HMIS).  TSHIP met or surpassed expected outputs, with especially high praise for the project’s community work and building effective community networks.   The community work has laid the groundwork for the local governments to strengthen health services in the two states.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Follow-on activities should be designed in collaboration with the key stakeholders (state and local governments and civil society) in the two states.  The Focus State Strategy should be continued as a strategic approach, not a project approach.  Future health projects should have gender strategies and work plans integrated into project design.  Ward Development Committees proved to be a valuable asset and a powerful tool for TSHIP and the entire health system strengthening/development process.",

Under the best of circumstances capacity building and behavior change are challenging to measure; the dynamic, experimental, adaptive approach of PAP, and the multiple behaviors it intended to change (water, energy and solid waste) among populations who were sometimes exposed to multiple campaigns, present a large number of variables that further challenges measurement for the purpose of comparison and attribution. Nonetheless, the evaluation uncovers evidence, lessons, and practices that can be incorporated into future programs for social marketing and energy, water, and waste management.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Effectiveness:\nPrior to identifying counterparts (government, municipalities, and utilities) and providing assistance, ensure agreement on priorities, strategies, and implementation mechanisms, and clearly articulating expectations and roles. \n\nSustainability:\nTo the extent possible, support JSMC to expand social marketing in Jordan (whether for energy conservation/savings or for other causes of social change) in order to leverage the investment made in its technical and management capabilities.\n\nLearning: \nFund the completion of Aqaba and Amman EDCO websites and replace or repair the malfunctioning solid waste equipment in Irbid.\n",

The value chains—coffee, sesame, chickpea, honey, wheat, and maize—were identified for their potential to improve both food security and incomes. The main goal of AGP is to sustainably reduce poverty and hunger and enhance economic growth. These goals are achieved by improving the productivity and competitiveness of value chains that offer jobs and income opportunities for rural households. The project goals were aligned with the AGP goals and the overarching Feed the Future Initiative (FtF) goal, “to sustainably reduce poverty and hunger.”",

      "Key Recommendations": "1. As quick as is practically possible, we recommend that the various on-going studies should be completed, particularly those focusing on identifying candidate genes, and published in refereed journals.\n\n2. It is critical that the project scientists pull together the results of studies to clearly validate and confirm the most significant candidate genes for heat tolerance.\n\n3. The project needs to determine what priority it will give to the formation, improvement, and testing of synthetics as OPVs.\n\n4. For this we recommend that number of entries particularly for Stage–III and MLT should be same for two seasons/two years.\n\n5. We strongly recommend that the short-term training courses be continued so that additional researchers/technical staff can benefit.",

      "Key Findings": "The evaluation found that the ACI project activities are likely to have raised farmers’ cocoa productivity and thereby increased food security (see below). These productivity improvements have occurred through the adoption of good agricultural practices promoted by the project: improved planting materials, improved extension, spraying services, and finance. A number of factors constrained this progress. The capacity-building and enabling environment strengthening initiatives of Component I and parts of Components II and III are long-term activities that should not have been expected to contribute to increased income and food security during the project period. A greater use of evidence-based policy advocacy in Component I could have accelerated progress in achieving reforms that would have laid the groundwork for increased cocoa household incomes.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Project management should have a full-time market facilitation specialist who proactively pursues opportunities for commercially sustainable inputs and service delivery.\n\nTo help spur these reforms, project management should include a full-time policy advocacy specialist.\n\nManagement should take better advantage of synergies between components and other cocoa initiatives.",

      "Key Findings": "• Site visits and KIIs revealed that SEDA provided community members with concrete skills in project design and implementation, increased hope in a positive future for their village, and a sense that as a community they can work with government to address key community needs.\n\n• SEDA’s design of three complementary, integrated components synergistically contributing to the achievement of overall program objectives is a conceptually sound model.\n• SEDA’s approach to strengthening the capacities of CDCs has created participatory structures and procedures that appear sustainable.\n\n• While SEDA has worked diligently to integrate gender awareness into all of its activities, it has not consistently achieved gender equality in terms of actual participation in these activities.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. SEDA should continue to engage and provide support to the GoAJ within the purview of its SOW and strengthen linkages and complementarity of these activities with its local socio-economic\ndevelopment initiatives.\n2. Cluster projects may offer an opportunity for mobilized communities to cooperatively engage in addressing larger socio-economic priorities. As such, they should be further explored by SEDA.\n3. SEDA/USAID should consider the potential benefits and trade-offs of increasing the size of SEDA’s infrastructure grants.\n4. Resources permitting, the current Component 1 model of CDC development could be productively expanded to additional regions of Azerbaijan.\n5. Should in the present economic context, USAID/Azerbaijan decide to focus on distinct economic development objectives, traditional program models of entrepreneurship training and support, SME and value-chain development must be considered in conjunction with the MoEI.",

At the beginning of the project, the PCA was a classic GDA in terms of management and implementation. Both USAID and its private sector partners had established common goals and private sector partners were deeply involved in project implementation. One of the Armajaro managers had moved from Ecuador to Peru mainly to help oversee this new alliance.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. Extend the PCA project for an additional three years.\n\n2. Examine the possibility of working jointly with the private sector during this three-year extension.\n\n3. Identify a neutral party entity that will have access to all the geo-referenced, fine flavored cocoa data.\n\n4. Establish a fee for service mechanism for the project.\n\n5. Assess which of the market-based approaches and solutions applied by the PCA may be replicated or adapted to benefit the results of other USAID projects or Government of Peru projects.",

      "Key Findings": "• The JA Program exhibited a solid overall employment creation or job placement rates for program participants who completed the program, with 74% of respondents reporting some form of employment at the time of the survey. At the start of the program only 28 youth reported some form of employment (20 were self-employed and eight were salaried workers.\n• Self-reported average annual earnings for those participants who both responded to the survey and reported income either pre- or post-program increased by about $626 (150%). This is likely a result of youth moving from unemployment to employment, rather than increases in income associated with movement from one type of employment to another.\n• According to survey results, participants increased their social and personal empowerment with a robust improvement in conflict management and professional ethics and modest gains in personal skills as a result of the program. Improvements were lowest for the applied technical skills related to the agricultural sector value chain.",
      "Key Recommendations": "• The JA project can best be seen as a pilot experiment in enabling youth to create employment in the agricultural value chain. Its successor could prepare youth for employment creation with more training on financial management, and achieve a higher level of success by providing more guidance and follow-up on financing for the youth enterprises. \n• Any future JA project will need a dedicated project manager in the home office to manage relations with the implementing partners and at least two or three support staff to oversee the training and identify problems that need attention.\n• A future project of this nature should incorporate at its starting point an analysis of prospective labor market demand trends at the sub-sectoral level; in order to assess where employment growth opportunities are likely to be greatest by sub-industry and region; in order to better focus/orient training programs in a manner which will maximize prospective impact on employment and income growth.",

      "Key Findings": "All 32 LGSP partner towns successfully developed or updated their socioeconomic development strategies. LGSP developed and implemented a Municipal Property/Asset Management System to help partner towns manage their local revenues and improve local services. LGSP developed 30 Local Energy Efficiency Plans (LEEPs) and Local Energy Efficiency Action Plans (LEEAPs) and trained 94 local public authority staff on energy efficiency, improving municipal awareness of and capacity in issues surrounding energy efficiency.\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "• More assistance is needed for operationalizing the integrated implementation of the national strategies, local development strategies, and urban plans. For example, towns must align their strategies with their financial resources and conduct continuous M&E on strategy implementation. \n• The CISC concept has proved its efficiency and several more towns have expressed their interest in implementing similar solutions at the town hall based on the success of the three pilot towns. There is a need for further decentralization to offer the town halls the ability to provide a larger range of services which currently are offered by different institutions, and the scope of the CISCs could be expanded as more services become the responsibility of LPAs. \n• Legislation on transparency in local public administration needs to be improved to improve enforcement of the requirement that publicize all information regarding council sessions and adopted decisions. \n• Improve the national policy and legal framework on public property management development, such as by establishing a new way to evaluate property value to strengthen property tax as a pillar of locally generated revenue.\n",

IPPF credits its participation in LMG with leading to an increased number of new family planning acceptors, from 481,000 to 725,000.\n\n• LMG supported and advised government-wide scale-up of leadership, management and governance curricula and programs in universities and ministries of health (MOH) in Ethiopia, Afghanistan, and Côte d’Ivoire.",
      "Key Recommendations": "• USAID needs to plan a detailed country-by-country hand-over of leadership, management and governance work to governments or legacy institutions. This will require GH field support teams to work with missions and regional bureaus to identify assistance mechanisms, if needed beyond 2016.\n• During Year 5, LMG should accelerate work to strengthen institutions, including WAHO, AHLMN, and African Centre for Global Health and Social Transformation (ACHEST). MSH should accelerate strengthening IPPFAR and AMREF Health Africa as its consortium partners.\n• USAID should consider extending for up to a year programs that will not complete by September 2016 due to external factors (elections, terrorism, Ebola), as well as the ICRC DCHA LMG work.\n",

      "Key Findings": "• Based on progress against targets, Digital Green believes that its video-enabled approach is an appropriate and useful tool to enhance public-private extension services in Afghanistan.\n• Manual phone interviews were found to be an effective tool for conducting adoption verifications, wherein, using a sample size of 43 randomly selected farmers out of 244 eligible farmers, physical observations confirmed farmers’ self-reported responses and the adoption data that extension agents and lead farmers reported in COCO 97.6% of the time. \n• IVRS, while promising for its ability to reduce possible bias and subjectivity, will require more testing and likely greater sensitization among farmers to prompt their engagement with the system. \n• The percentage of women who engaged in video production and dissemination activities was higher than anticipated. Digital Green believes that engaging female extension workers and motivating them to engage more women were keys to this achievement. This emphasis on female extension workers has proven to be useful to programs like the AAEP-WIA.\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "NHLP is particularly keen to leverage Digital Green’s approach to extend their horticulture extension program. They have expressed a need for technical assistance and monitoring support to plan and execute video’s inclusion. Digital Green and NHLP are both concerned that a gap between the pilot project’s completion and the launch of new activities may result in the loss of momentum among trained partners, extension agents, lead farmers, communities engaged under the pilot.  In light of low levels of literacy and high levels of insecurity in Afghanistan, Digital Green and the Director General of Agriculture believe that technological solutions, such as IVRS, warrant further investigation, testing, and application in Afghanistan.",

      "Key Findings": "• The evaluation team determined that the LEAD project was successful in stimulating investment, primarily measured by funds matched by LEAD grantees.\n\n• Although LEAD activities for capturing Diaspora remittances conform to best practices documented in the literature reviewed by the evaluators, by the end of 2015 LEAD had limited success in testing and effectively implementing new methods for capturing Diaspora remittances for development.\n\n• Diaspora SME and local grantees confirmed that access to financing is a major roadblock for them, and they credit LEAD for removing that constraint through the matching funds.\n\n• LEAD succeeded in stimulating SMEs to improve their business practices, despite a few inconsistencies cited by BPC applicants regarding clear guidance on trainings and processes.\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. We recommend that USAID insure continuity and sustainability of the LEAD project even beyond 2017, the year the project is scheduled to end.\n\n2. We recommend a small grant management unit with six to ten grantees assigned to each manager and oversight from a senior\nlevel position.\n\n3. PADF should develop clear communications protocols for each part of the process to increase transparency across the board.\n\n4. Implement steps to recruit more SEs and CBOs by using innovative communication channels.\n\n5. Implement steps to extend capacity building (business plans, project writing seminars) to CBOs as a means of securing better quality applications to the community project component.",

      "Key Findings": "There is substantial momentum for water supply and sanitation development in Indonesia, with the national government setting new sector targets to achieve Universal Access in drinking water and sanitation by the end of 2019, making available significant budgets and taking measures to strengthen the financial position of district water enterprises. In achieving these targets, the national government is working closely with district governments and water enterprises, which are the key institutions, responsible for WASH at the local level. IUWASH has established excellent relations with the local governments (LG) and PDAMs it has been working with. Over a period of 5 years, it has provided a wide range of advisory and supporting services and at the LG level, it has helped to create considerable momentum, as demonstrated by the doubling of LG water and sanitation budgets during the same period. IUWASH advisers have often taken the role of a catalyst, bringing stakeholders together in resolving common problems and stimulating and supporting action. In doing so, IUWASH has adopted a hands-on and flexible approach, which is very much appreciated by both LG institutions and communities.",
      "Key Recommendations": "The quality and use of IUWASH CKM products can be further improved by Applying standard peer reviews by GOI and relevant sector experts from other projects and development partners.  \nGender Mainstreaming: Decide at an early stage (in design or start-up) the extent to which gender should be mainstreamed under IUWASH Plus and ensure that this is backed up by the resources (staffing and budgets) necessary to succeed in such programming.  The following recommendations are intended either for IUWASH or, given that it will very soon come to a close, consideration by the follow-on project or other WASH activity that may carry on its activities. \nSuch recommendations include: a. Support the national and local governments to review and strengthen the application of STBM in urban and peri-urban areas, , including correction of any deficiencies in the theoretical underpinnings, differentiation for various target groups, and identifying indicators for behavioral change. Social marketing and participatory investment planning may provide a useful platform for such a revised strategy and the strategy should more expressly address both water supply and sanitation related programming.\n",

      "Key Recommendations": "Through the end of the current project lifecycle, AYP should continue to engage the CEOs and DEOs in the community-based transition plan meetings. AYP should also work to share and integrate monitoring tools to strengthen the capacity of interested individuals among the county and district staff; there are some extremely bright and motivated individuals in these positions who would welcome an opportunity to expand their capacity in this area.  In the remaining time of AYP, the project needs to implement its community transition plan and aid the ABE committees in helping to think through how they will keep their structure, continue to exist and carry out their responsibilities. This way, the committees can sustain the retention of learners.  For the remaining period of AYP’s implementation, the activity should continue to support the activities of PTIs and youth clubs to provide skills training for learners. This should include the extension of short-term skills training from PTIs to additional members of the community as needed and desired by the communities.",

      "Key Findings": "Through the District Management Committees, SDS has greatly enhanced coordination of various key implementers in the local governments (LGs).\n\nThe robust SDS grants management and other financial accountability indicators were used to strictly assess district performance every quarter, with results determining eligibility levels for subsequent disbursements.\n\nThe SDS program was a complementary mechanism for strengthening LG systems by providing financial as well as technical support to complement resources from the DBTA programs.\n\nThe original SDS program design was robust enough to accommodate all the modifications.\n\nUnder the SDS program, districts received both grants and TA aimed at strengthening decentralized systems and processes so as to enhance the LG’s ownership, autonomy, and independence.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. In order to consolidate the gains made in strengthening LG systems, USAID should continue providing technical and financial support to the districts.\n\n2. The PBF principle should be maintained and embedded across all granting mechanisms. Districts that demonstrate compliance to the set PBF criteria should be given more discretionary funds to address locally identified priorities.\n\n3. Modifications to future similar programs should, to the extent possible, involve the implementing partners right from the outset to ensure ownership and improve chances of sustainability.\n\n4. In the future, in situations involving more than one TA arm, there is a need to synchronize policies and priorities so as to realize the intended synergies.\n\n5. All national level players deemed critical for achieving program results should be fully integrated in the program design with clear roles, responsibilities, and expected outputs.",

      "Key Recommendations": "It is recommended that USAID allocate resources to finance a market survey.\n\nFuture program designed by USAID and its partners should take into account the incentives of all actors (Mobile Money Operators (MNOs), consumers, agents, merchants, financial institutions) in\norder to foster the development of an effective ecosystem.\n\nFuture programming in the microfinance sector must continue to include support for the adoption of ICT and the acquisition of operating assets that strengthen the capacity of FIs.\n\nFuture USAID programming should consider offering more flexible loan terms (particularly the principal amount) that take into account a beneficiary’s ability to repay.\n\nAgricultural insurance is vital for the development of the sector and it is important to provide support for related schemes; for instance, facilitating agricultural risk sharing among MFIs or extending Development Credit Authority (DCA).",

Undertake a stakeholder and results mapping exercise to ensure that the future iteration of the Trade Hub makes informed decisions about new and follow-on activities, as well as builds on the results, knowledge, and relationships generated by the previous project. \n2. As part of the review process described above, be sure to assess former Trade Hub activities that were considered complete, in order to ascertain whether the intended results and objectives have been sustained by the stakeholders.\n3. Implement a formalized process to assess requests for support from USAID and host country counterparts.\n",

      "Document Title": "Citizens' Voice Project (CVP) Final Performance Evaluation",
      "Key Findings": "1. Relevance: Grant activities were highly relevant to stakeholder and beneficiary interests, mostly due to grantees’ consulting with local communities and relying on their local knowledge when selecting grant activities.\n\n2. Effectiveness: Grants effectively facilitated engagement between citizens and the government.\n\n3. Sustainability: CVP encouraged sustainability from the start of the grant process by requiring grantees to submit sustainability plans.\n\n4. Grants Under Contract: The two delivery mechanisms that supported CVP’s successful programming were 1) the GUC contractual grant framework between USAID and implementing partner Trust for Democratic Education and Accountability (TDEA) and 2) the Fixed Amount Award (FAA) grant funds disbursal system to grantees.\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. The implementing partner should initiate formal linkages with the government at the beginning of the implementation process.\n\n2. The implementing partner of future similar projects should emphasize including high-impact activities, such as information campaigns and community-level meetings, in the request for\napplications (RFA) process and throughout the activity planning stage.\n\n3. The implementing partner should increase the number of grantee capacity-building trainings relative to CVP and conduct the trainings early in the grant startup phase to build the capabilities of grantee organizations before grants begin.\n\n4. The implementing partner should create an effective payment system to improve the grantee experience relative to that under CVP by increasing payments for initial milestone deliverables, reducing the total number of milestone deliverables, and creating an escrow account so the project can access additional program funds when necessary to continue project activities. 5. The implementing partner should develop a communications manual alongside a Grant Management Information System (GMIS) training presentation to improve communication between the project and grantees and deploy both during an off-site retreat with grantees.\n",

      "Key Findings": "1. The Team found no evidence of a cold chain in Bangladesh, but did find evidence of a frozen food chain not linked to any of the project’s subsectors (fresh vegetables, poultry, or dairy).\n\n2. The Evaluation Team did not find evidence of economic viability in marketing vegetables through a cold chain system after three years of operating the pilot project.\n\n3. Attempts to leverage private sector investment were unsuccessful.\n\n4. The sustainability of the CCBA intervention faced two major constraints.\n\n5. CCBA incorporated gender in its project interventions on a limited scale.\n\n6. The project included a study document (CCBA 2014f, without authorship, dated April 2014) that was somewhat comprehensive, but it did not assess the demand for fresh vegetables by upscale\nretailers and consumers.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. High-value vegetable producers in the initial Collection Centers established by CCBA as of the end of Year 2 of the project should continue to be assisted by the FtF Bangladesh AVC Program, particularly related to the second component of the CCBA project.\n\n2. Despite the lack of progress in cold chain development in the CCBA project, there must be a continued effort by international donors to encourage cold chain implementation in Bangladesh.\n\n3. USAID should continue to invest in PPPs related to cold chain development for high-value crops in Bangladesh.\n\n4. Critical for the project: the ability to extend the shelf life of HVVs at Collection Centers should be part of a strategy to cope with such external factors.\n\n5. Despite cultural traditions, USAID projects should strive to incorporate women in higher-level positions in agriculture, processing, or the provision of services.\n\n6. Future GDA proposal implementers should research carefully to ensure a complete and common understanding of mutual objectives among all parties.",

      "Key Recommendations": "1. Continue support for job creation in Tunisia’s Interior Regions\n2. Continue to work with HP-LIFE\n3.

      "Key Findings": "DOH systems strengthening in data, supply chain and training: Given the enhanced policy and budgetary environment the DOH enjoys the gaps evident in the public sector supply chain, data management and utilization system, and the DOH’s ability to reach LGUs with technical systems and leadership training, this would be an opportune time to reposition USAID’s portfolio from being an extension of DOH services and training to one that partners with the DOH to strengthen government systems and develop the systems needed to contract out for technical services. \n\nPhilHealth: PhilHealth is an integral part of moving toward universal health care (UHC) in the Philippines. USAID has enabled facilities and individuals to enter the PhilHealth system, and despite policies aimed at meeting the needs of the poor and an exemplary showing, PhilHealth experience in moving social insurance to clients in a decentralized health system demonstrates a need for better clarity and evidence-based expansion of the packages.  Policy development: The University of the Philippines Economic Foundation (UPecon) and others have helped developed laws and guidance and conducted studies on a wide range of topics, the Zuellig Family Foundation (ZFF) program has raised awareness and skills among LGU leaders to address health issues and track progress, and both the ID and MNCHN/FP projects have contributed to policy development.\n\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "DOH systems strengthening in data, supply chain and training: Work on these initiatives will require development of or improvements in DOH procurement mechanisms to engage third party technical assistance and training.\n\nPhilHealth: USAID is well positioned to explore a direct working partnerships with PhilHealth at both the national and regional levels, focused on increasing access to quality MNCHN/FP and ID packages, and better linking of PhilHealth and providers at regional and local levels.\n\nPolicy development: Recommended policy activities for the future include: capacitating the DOH’s Health Policy Development and Planning Bureau; improving the flow of information about government policies (especially those of PhilHealth); tapping CSOs, the media and other institutions to improve accountability of government or as a watchdog for the private sector; and a plan for policy analysis for specific audiences that addresses timely issues, based on USAID’s experience at the national and regional levels, such as health services and rights of minors, women’s health as a human right, and role of medicines in UHC.\n",

      "Key Findings": "• On the demand side Mobile Money Accelerator Program (MMAP) stimulated awareness and MM uptake based on the fact that training of MMAP pilot users (farmers, agents, VSLA, social cash transfer recipients, etc.) enabled people to have a much better understanding of the features and benefits of MM.\n\n• On the supply and regulatory sides MMAP was less conclusive. On the regulatory/legislative front MMAP was a key informant for the Reserve Bank of Malawi (RBM) but had no impact on the intractable Parliamentary process. \n\n• In addition, USAID’s Malawi FtF Strategy (May 2011) was not informed by the USAID Financial Sector Knowledge Sharing Mobile Money National Action Plan (November 2011), which explains the absence of MM in the FtF Strategy.\n\n• During the lifespan of MMAP up to March 31, 2016 there has been significant growth of MM in Malawi. Transaction volume doubled over the same base number of agents.",
      "Key Recommendations": "• There is need for direct technical assistance to institutionalize sustainable change as compared to how MMAP defined technical assistance\n• Successful MM implementation must begin internally with management and staff who understand the business case for their organization and adopt m-wallets themselves before they try to convince farmers and other beneficiaries to use the same product/service",

      "Key Findings": "The amount of work carried to produce financial reports and the trainings necessary to withstand work endured by staff to comply with USAID rules and regulations may dilute effort and detract from objectives. The lack of financial reserves provisions may hinder the financial independence of the local organizations. But, if implemented with caution and piloted to trusted partners, in the long run they may ensure a stronger civil society that will have more political courage to affect social change and stronger advocacy voices. Management and administrative capacities of IP’s staff are improved as a result of working with USAID Albania. The policies and procedures, internal control systems have been designed and implemented in a highly competent manner, guided by a coherent strategy.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Although reporting mechanism and robust internal systems and processes ensure accountability on the use of funds, more attention needs to be paid on ensuring NGO’s remain in touch with the realities and the needs the community they serve. Donors should include in their fund-raising training modules alternative fundraising mechanism, for example, crowdsourcing that can also increase communication and engagement with constituents and supporters of the causes NGOs are promoting. Additionally, the future projects supported by USAID Albania should have business sustainability as their primary goal since the advocacy and all activities rely on funding. Encourage the system of providing an endowment from donations by strengthening the role of board members to increase funds scrutiny, and setting clear guidelines on the ways and events when endowment funds can be used. Provided that the core objectives of the project are accomplished, less intrusive procedures4 from USAID Albania could be established.",

While FTFMS data show that most value chains are on target to meet fiscal year (FY) 2016 and/or FY 2017 outcome-level targets and that Feed the Future assisted many smallholders to expand their production of staple and micronutrient-dense crops, the sustainability of those outcomes with respect to agricultural productivity in some countries has been negatively impacted due to the effects of the recent El Niño.  All four indicators measuring IR 8 (improved use of maternal and child nutrition services) displayed a positive trend in aggregate performance and overall, the portfolio reviews show that almost all focus countries are on track to meet the FY 2016 portfolio review target on nutritional impact and activity-level results.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. Provide clear guidance on integrating agriculture and nutrition\n\n2. Revise monitoring systems to capture and reward systems-level work\n\n3.

      "Key Findings": "• The Growth, Health and Governance (GHG) program  improved nutrition outcomes of children under two.\n• The evaluation identifies non-traditional factors as contributors to under nutrition in Karamoja\n• GHG’s new Care Group Model was more effective at improving nutrition outcomes in Karamoja.\n• The evaluation found that safe water and community-led total sanitation (CLTS) activities were effective at combating undernutrition in Karamoja.\n• Gender equity was identified as a key factor in children’s undernutrition.\n• The evaluation confirmed that market facilitation delivers results, even where markets are initially lacking.",
      "Key Recommendations": "A number of recommendations are made in the report, a few of these are mentioned below.\n\n1. Growth:\n• Promote the cultivation and crop protection (pests and disease) of bio-fortified food crops that are adapted to farming systems in the Karamoja Region.\n• Pivot to include adolescents in training on life skills and business management to create employment and entrepreneurship opportunities for girls and boys as alternatives to early marriage and pregnancy.\n\n2. Health and Nutrition:\n• Continue partnerships with the District Health Office (DHO) to assist with planning and budgeting of health facilities and services with a five-year health plan for the districts.\n• Upgrade the capacity of the village health team (VHT)/community health workers (CHW) with appropriate IT tools for better delivery of information and services to the households.\n\n3. Governance:\n• Continue to reduce the number of conflicts with continued support to peace groups, youth-led community based organizations (YCOB) and government agencies.\n• Support women’s involvement in decision-making in mitigating the impacts of climate change because\nwomen are mainly responsible for food production and are more vulnerable to the effects of climate change.\n",

      "Key Findings": "• First, the nature of the USAID design process coupled with EAC protocols often means that experienced line staff implementing projects at the EAC and within Partner States, are not included in the design phase of projects.\n\n• Secondly, M&E systems across most activities are perceived as inadequate, focusing on outputs rather than outcomes.\n\n• Third, PREPARED lacked an effective overall community strategy for engaging and communicating with stakeholders including EAC Partner States and regional organizations, on project matters.\n\n• Fourth, in several instances, custom indicators for the PREPARED M&E plan may have better reflected the project's strengths and weaknesses. Indicators reflected outputs rather than outcomes.\n\n• Finally, the team found that most activities will require an accelerated effort to become sustainable after PREPARED support ends.\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. It is recommended that USAID/KEA makes a concerted effort to facilitate a more inclusive project design process for regional programs.\n\n2. It is recommended that an outcome-based M&E system be established.\n\n3. It is recommended that PREPARED should compile a living\ndocument to illustrate lessons learned throughout the project’s life.\n\n4. It is recommended that USAID/KEA use such custom indicators for projects similar to PREPARED.\n\n5. It is recommended that this become the primary focus for the remaining life of the project.",

      "Key Findings": "The main findings and conclusions underscore the considerable contributions that SIAPS and its collaborating partners made towards organizing, regulating and controlling the purchase, storage and distribution of Angola's medical supplies. After conducting an initial assessment, SIAPS identified key gaps in the Angolan public supply chain (SC) systems, which included: inadequate coordination of SC stakeholder efforts and the lack of a national coordination mechanism or platform; the lack of a national SC strategy; the lack of a national medicines regulatory system; suboptimal logistics management information systems (LMIS); poor availability and lack of a culture of consistent use of data to inform decision-making; and inadequate performance measurement and monitoring for improvement across all levels of the SC system.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Primary recommendations include: stronger advocacy by USAID, including urging the GRA Ministry of Health to approve and implement SIAPS policy documents and manuals (see Annex V), and to maintain USAID’s engagement with and advocacy of the government. Continued cooperation among implementing partners and stakeholders (a practice inaugurated by SIAPS) is encouraged as it presents opportunities for increasing both human and non-human resources and coordination. Additional training and resources are needed, both to maintain the systems and staffing that SIAPS put into place, and to strengthen the coordination and management of Angola’s pharmaceutical delivery system throughout the country, particularly in the provinces and municipalities.",

      "Key Recommendations": "1. Consider the creation or utilization of existing communication and knowledge management platforms within USG to share knowledge about the experience of Enterprise Funds and Legacy Foundations. \n2. An even more structured alternative to knowledge sharing would be a consolidation of the management of the Enterprise Funds. \n3. Define what a reasonable expectation from the Funds in terms of effecting development impact would be and what appropriate and sufficient reporting metrics would be expected. \n4. Consider setting up a structure such as an Advisory Board of professionals with relevant private equity, venture capital, commercial and investment banking, advisory and legal experience as well as retired USAID personnel.\n5. Consider using legal counsel with experience in private equity and the financial industry when negotiating contracts and compensation plans with Enterprise Funds’ Boards.\n",

      "Key Findings": "• Design and effectiveness: The effectiveness of the program was constrained by the limited capacity of IPs to influence its two most critical aspects: beneficiary numbers and graduate numbers.\n\n• MCHN/WASH: DFAP messaging has proved effective in changing attitudes.\n\n• Capacity development: Current approaches to capacity development, although much appreciated, are constrained by staff turnover.\n\n• Graduation: For the poorer households, progress towards graduation is slow and not dramatically enhanced by community assets or MCHN/WASH activities.\n\n• Gender equality and empowerment: Progress is inherently gradual; nevertheless, repetition and a diversified “multichannel” approach have proven effective, especially when Health Extension Workers (HEWs) and schools have been involved.\n\n• Program management and sustainability: The capacity of management to coordinate different interventions within a layered approach has definitely enhanced program outcomes.\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "1.To achieve program goals and objectives: \nConsider the reinstatement of full family targeting and fortified vegetable oil in the ration, as well as the introduction of variable month transfers (3–6–9), depending upon household needs.\n2. To enhance the graduation process:\nAdvocate for a more comprehensive role for IPs in the graduation process from which they are currently excluded, especially in the application of the GPS and targeting processes. \n3. To strengthen the DFAPs’ contribution to gender equity: \nDFAPs should continue the process of empowerment, reaching out to both men and women through social behavior change communication (SBCC), while strengthening girl’s and women’s education. \n4. To strengthen program management: \nM&E units should reduce the number of output indicators and increase the use of small KPC (Knowledge, Practice, and Coverage) Surveys and other assessments to guide management on a more frequent basis.\n5. To enhance program sustainability: \nIncreased emphasis is required on family planning.\n",

      "Key Findings": "EHELD was successful in establishing CoEs at both universities, including: updating curricula and developing specialized fields of study, upgrading laboratory equipment and resource rooms, providing scholarships to nearly 300 students and 22 faculty members to acquire degrees in target fields, and facilitating 29 CF to teach at the two colleges to enhance quality through provision of new classes and capacity building support for local faculty (LF).  \nOne of the primary challenges of EHELD was the complex relationship between the implementing partner (IP) and the other various stakeholders, including the two beneficiary universities, as well as the three US-based universities involved as consortium partners.EHELD’s consortium members worked in close collaboration with all stakeholders to offer an updated, comprehensive, and specialized learning experience for students, including the development of three professional specializations at the Center for Agriculture and Sustainable Development (CASD) and integrating active learning approaches.\n",
      "Key Recommendations": "The CoEs are strong assets that should be supported to transition to locally-owned entities, as they work to implement sustainability strategies to maintain their status as premier educational institutions in their select fields. Continue to explore innovative strategies to make school fees affordable for students, and other funding sources to reduce dependency on school fees (FFS, research grants, etc.). Train students and faculty to perform routine maintenance on equipment, where appropriate, to reduce maintenance costs. Explore strategies to increase awareness and utilization of valuable CoE resources, such as lab equipment, among relevant partners. Expand the role of the internship coordinator to network with the PS, so that the university can start facilitating support for graduates to find jobs.",

      "Key Findings": "The recent accelerated pace of the HIV/TB program as a result of South Africa’s adoption of the 90-90-90 goals and UTT requires a commensurate increase in capacity within the health system. USAID’s focus on Health Systems Strengthening/Capacity Building (HSS/CB) has been a relatively sound strategy for improving and expanding HIV/AIDS services in South Africa. DSPs have positively contributed to strengthening the six health system building blocks in their respective districts, but most especially the 3 building blocks of service delivery, health workforce, and information management.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. Engage in a transparent and open dialogue with Provincial DOHs about USAID’s mandate to, and expectations of, the partners it finances in the province.\n2. Support DOH in improving overall HR Performance Management\n3. Align PEPFAR and DOH planning/implementation processes and MER indicators/processes.\n4. Continue to support M&E to address critical capacity gaps and data backlogs.\n5. Identify key HSS/CB indicators to be reported on by DSPs when technical assistance/capacity building is the main focus of the project.\n6. Review the performance of districts that have “graduated” from DSP support to identify lessons learned and success/sustainability factors.\n",

      "Key Findings": "• Strengthening of national governments’ and regional entities’ capacity for analysis and policy formulation related to trade facilitation and food security was one of the major accomplishments of the activities, mostly through training and technical assistance.\n• RTMA’s grants program contributed to producer organizations capacity building in the administrative, accounting, and financial areas, as well as their decision-making capacities.\n• RTMA’s contribution to changes in income consumption patterns and living standards of small farmers were not found.\n• There were no significant instances of collaboration among the four Strategy activities, nor they were mandated by it, or otherwise monitored or evaluated.\n• Activities did contribute to the dissemination and use of science, technology and innovation for agricultural practices among small farmers, mostly through training and technical assistance.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Although this is not an evaluation of the management performance of USAID/CAM, based on all the findings related to the effectiveness of the Strategy and each one of its activities, mentioned in Section 4.2 it is recommendable to emphasize that implementation of activities be more than managing a contract or an award with an IP. It should include an active process of defining realistic expected results, monitoring progress toward the achievement of expected results, learning and integrating lessons learned into management decisions, and reporting on performance. To reinforce a culture of results-based management, a set of practices are recommended: 1) holding managers accountable; 2) empowering managers; 3) focusing on bringing about change in the lives of activity beneficiaries; 4) regularly checking the effectiveness of policies and procedures; 5) establishing a culture of learning; 6) building internal capacities; and 7) sharing and communicating results.",

      "Key Findings": "MIDAS was conceived as an attempt to address and resolve the most critical issues impeding rapid development of the mining industry. Though the MIDAS interventions were and are critically needed, the planned scope was perhaps too ambitious given the project resources committed by USAID and the degree of disorder and dysfunction within MoMP. The opportunity for success was further hampered by the unexpected - though not unforeseeable - commodity price collapse that began during the MIDAS design phase and the inability of GIRoA, despite numerous attempts over the preceding decade, to pass a workable mining law.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Because of the high turnover rates within MoMP, capacity building efforts should be continued. The capacity builders must be specialists within their fields, and must be embedded with their counterparts to provide on-the-job training experiences. The MoMP must be an active partner in designing capacity building interventions. Based upon its historical success and reputation at the MoMP, the U.S. Geological Survey should be the primary agency responsible for capacity building at AGS.",

      "Key Findings": "First, the nature of the USAID design process coupled with EAC protocols often means that experienced line staff implementing projects at the EAC and within Partner States, are not included in\nthe design phase of projects.\n\nSecondly, M&E systems across most activities are perceived as inadequate, focusing on outputs rather than outcomes.\n\nThird, PREPARED should compile a living document to illustrate lessons learned throughout the project’s life.\n\nFourth, in several instances, custom indicators for the PREPARED M&E plan may have better reflected the project's strengths and\nweaknesses.\n\nFinally, the team found that most activities will require an accelerated effort to become sustainable after PREPARED support ends.",
      "Key Recommendations": "It is recommended that USAID/KEA make a concerted effort to facilitate a more inclusive project design process for regional programs.\n\nIt is recommended that an outcome-based M&E system be established.\n\nIt is recommended that USAID/KEA use such custom indicators for projects similar to PREPARED.\n\nIt is recommended that sustainability become the primary focus for the remaining life of the project.",

      "Key Findings": "1. RCCP developed common definitions, practical methodologies, and tools to help different countries move forward on customized REDD+ issues.\n\n2. At the beginning of the Program, REDD+ was not a well understood task, but it was a priority for RCCP to align REDD+ closely with the policies of those countries in order to reduce deforestation and vulnerability, and create employment by using the REDD+ development pathways following national environmental laws and work plans.\n\n3. There were numerous activities that facilitated the transfer of knowledge and skills to stakeholders at different levels. However, other than the general learning goals for these events expressed in training plans, the Team did not find information regarding how learning is measured.\n\n4. RCCP has played a key role in strengthening capacities and providing technical advice, tools and methodologies. Most of the countries in Central America were not ready for REDD+ when the RCCP began, but they are now working toward this end.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. To enrich REDD+ strategies and restoration strategies, CATIE should finalize and publish the MAS tool.\n\n2. USAID/CAM, in collaboration with CCAD, and possibly with GIZ, should develop a mechanism to exchange information between the USAID bilateral Missions, and also between different projects under different donors involved in similar thematic areas.\n\n3. In future programs, USAID should consider requiring that programs and projects have a training program with clear goals and objectives that go beyond the quantitative performance indicators.\n\n4. Ministries of Environment in the Central American region should continue to update and prepare statements about their readiness in REDD+.",

When communities need a water source4, have a sense of buy-in/ownership, have access to spare parts and repair services, and the well is reasonably constructed, they are highly motivated to maintain it. \n2. SWSS’s quality assurance processes directed at ensuring construction companies correctly installed wells appear to have been relatively successful, and may be the main source of the\nmodestly better-than-average performance of its wells. \n3. SWSS well performance was also supported by the long-term ongoing work of other actors in the field, including MRRD and DACAAR, particularly with respect to the widespread availability of spare parts and trained pump mechanics.",
      "Key Recommendations": "For implementers of current and future water supply projects:\n1. Document processes and results clearly, to allow for proper follow-up and improve the sector’s capacity to learn from experience.\n2. Previous to constructing any wells, develop a tracking system with clear unambiguous identification codes.\n3. Recognize community strengths5 and use existing community structures and processes where possible, while being cognizant that in some communities, leaders may not represent everyone’s interests or may attempt to capture project benefits for themselves and their families.\n4. Needs assessment should be done routinely as part of water supply construction, learning from best practices already documented by DACAAR.\n5. Community contributions to well construction, especially in the form of labor, should be a requirement. ",

      "Key Recommendations": "Considering the significant progress achieved to develop national LEDS, USAID should reassess the capacity needs of partner countries in key LEDS areas.\n\nContinue to focus on removing barriers to clean energy implementation.\n\nContinue to support the analysis of mitigation options, as needed: each EC-LEDS country should receive continued support in data analysis of GHG inventories, cost-benefit analysis, and marginal abatement cost curves, if required to further define and implement their mitigation priorities.\n\nContinue to manage the program as per the current structure; however, revisit the performance reporting system to standardize performance information reporting across agencies and to focus on assessment of capacity achievements as per core LEDS components and the implementation of LEDS-related mitigation actions.",

      "Key Findings": "By and large, GIG has largely achieved or exceeded the output indicator targets in its M&E Plan.\n\nWhile GIG has experienced success in parts of its intervention, there remain some important shortfalls in its design, implementation, and performance.\n\nThere is a lack of a clear logical connection between the output indicators and the KRAs, and somewhat differing understandings between the GVN, USAID, and GIG on the overall purpose of GIG, its objectives, and its implementation process.\n\nWhile most counterparts valued the technical support from GIG, others reported that the support they received was not useful, inconsistent, and/or led to a lack of ownership as they felt that GIG imposed its agenda or placed logistical restrictions on them that they did not consider warranted.",
      "Key Recommendations": "● Establish regular, face-to-face meetings with the PMU on at least a monthly basis to discuss project implementation, operations, and performance.\n● Increase GIG transparency and information sharing with the PMU including for activity-related spending, activity budgets, funds remaining for activities, implementation constraints and opportunities, and proposed strategies.\n● Develop a sustainability strategy for the remaining implementation period.\n● Develop a learning strategy for the remaining implementation period so that the key counterparts can continue with on their own after GIG ends.\n● Develop the Year 5 work plan through frank and open conversations with the PMU, Steering Committee, and key counterparts.",

The program has successfully established foundations for long-term conservation and demonstrated the conservation approaches that are relevant to conservation needs in the South Sudan. The primary goal of ensuring the survival of the wildlife population has been reasonably realized, but more investments are needed to consolidate these foundations. The program has satisfactorily achieved performance indicators in the Performance Monitoring Report (PMP), with exceptional performance in targets for patrols and aerial surveys. Given the prevailing political and security environment, the progress made by the program is commendable since the factors that hindered better performance were external to the program.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Wildlife and natural resources management:\nContinue to provide support implementation of park management plans for Bandingilo and Boma National Parks focusing on capacities for anti-poaching, conflict management and wildlife\nmanagement.\n\nLivelihood improvement:\nIncrease supports to local NGO partners to enable them consolidate and scale up livelihood activities support and peace building initiatives.\n\nImproving policy performance:\nLobby for approval of the following policy and legal frameworks and guidelines that were prepared in concluded phase: i) National Tourism Strategy and associated regulation; ii) Strategic Plan for the National Resources Management Group (NRMG); iii) proposals for extending the size of protected areas; iv) Natural Resources Policy; and v) a framework for land use planning.",

      "Key Recommendations": "To transfer more activities to local prime implementing partners, EDO’s resources should be augmented and some interventions implemented by local prime implementing partners.\n\nTo increase the likelihood of success of interventions implemented by local prime implementing partners in the economic growth sector, a new pre-award assessment tool should be introduced.\n\nRisk management should be improved, and AOR/COR involvement should be frequent and substantive throughout implementation.",

Implementation has occurred through a collaborative and participatory process, with a conscious plan to ensure that the model and development process are fully Egyptian, and integrated into the MOE institutional structure. The strong sense of commitment and ownership voiced by stakeholders at all levels, in the schools and in the ministry, attest to the impact of this approach.",
      "Key Recommendations": "USAID should support the MOE to develop a comprehensive plan for institutionalizing the STEM school model, addressing fundamental governance structures and arrangements, both within and outside the ministry, at the central, governorate, and school levels.\n\nIn response to teacher uncertainty and dissatisfaction, the MOE, through PAT, should define the parameters of the career path for STEM teachers, within the provisions of the Special Cadre for Teachers Law, and institutionalize a corresponding professional development system.\n\nUSAID should collaborate with the MOE to explore alternative approaches to partnering with the private sector and the community, based on a mutually beneficial relationship, and draw upon the experience in the US with partnerships between private firms and government entities.\n\nThe MOE should ensure that an efficient and reliable management mechanism is in place, with adequate financial resources for infrastructure, equipment maintenance, and supplies.\n\nUSAID and the Central STEM Unit should expand the mechanisms for strengthening and supporting teachers, within the schools and during the work week, building on the emerging experience with team teaching, coaching and mentoring, and peer support networks.",

      "Key Findings": "With respect to the NRM Project assumptions, the evaluation found them to be inadequate (i.e., they were either not comprehensive and/or there were sufficient gaps in the Project design to render some of them inapplicable).\n\nIn terms of integration and coordination, the evaluation found that each activity contributed to improved stewardship of NRM to varying degrees, often marginal, but there was lack of sufficient\ncoordination and integration efforts to build synergies and ensure that the total contributions of the NRM Project was greater than the sum of its constituent parts.\n\nUSAID’s Monitoring, Evaluation, and Learning Program (MELP) for NRM identified four categories of direct threats to biodiversity.\n\nIn terms of governance, the Project primarily focused on supporting Wildlife Management Areas (WMAs) as a tool for promoting access and control (or property rights) over resources.\n\nOverall, the WOPE found the current level of private sector engagement, the level of economic benefits, and their distribution insufficient to contribute to poverty alleviation and empower local groups, especially women and youth.",
      "Key Recommendations": "The Project should support a wider range of tools and instruments that increase both property and procedural rights.\n\nThe NRM Project should aim at generating a wider scope of benefits through private and public sector actors beyond economic ones, as well as supporting mechanisms that ensure those benefits accrue at community, household, and individual levels.\n\nSystematic integration of gender variables in the design of all activities, implementation, and monitoring systems is required if gender goals are to be met.\n\nThere is no value added in the portfolio but there should be—the missed opportunity is a major cause of slow progress on NRM in\nTanzania.\n\nThe WOPE has underlined a number of related issues; among them are the inability to scale up evidence and use it for real-time decision-making, lack of sharing of lessons learned and best practices across the project, and inadequate adaptive management for changing context.\n\nA principle of USAID and its Biodiversity Policy is the long-term environmental, financial, and social sustainability and viability of benefits, impacts, and results.",

      "Key Findings": "PFG’s influence on the USG-GOG bilateral relationship was particularly evident in the partnership’s convening power, the USG provision of research studies and policy documents for decision-making, and PFG’s creative approaches to supporting select GOG institutions and projects through USAID’s Financing Ghanaian Agriculture Project (FinGAP). The lack of new funding streams, however, was an obstacle to PFG’s implementation and success.\n\nAs an addendum to the JCAP, PFG in Ghana developed a monitoring and evaluation (M&E) framework with quantifiable metrics for all 10 goals, including 22 indicators related to the power sector and 27 indicators related to the credit sector. Per the M&E framework, all TWGs were required to adhere to these metrics to ensure consistency and accuracy in reporting. An integral part of the M&E framework was the semiannual scorecards, which reported progress toward macro-, goal-, and LOA-level indicators. ",
      "Key Recommendations": "• Establish a clear exit strategy and sustainability plan;\n• Preserve and more fully institutionalize indicator collecting and reporting practices; and\n• Hold a final convening of all USG and GOG personnel actively participating in PFG to enable a final sharing of ideas and experiences and ensure that lessons learned from PFG are not lost.",

",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. Integrate some aspects of the WEA approach, with its core element of women’s empowerment in agriculture, in other USAID/Bangladesh FTF programs where applicable.\n\n2. Provide additional, hands-on technical training for WEA women beneficiaries.\n\n3. Consider alternative vocabulary to “women’s empowerment” to reduce resistance.\n\n4. Organize and facilitate additional workshops for women with market actors.\n\n5. Enhance training on accounting systems for VSLs members and start a new VSL cycle.\n\n6. Consolidate WEA gains.",

Effectively responding to the needs of GOI institutions requires building the capacity in many forestry and climate change topics and addressing the importance of training a wide spectrum of stakeholders within the government (including upper-level, mid-level, and front-line field staff.)\n\n3. USAID programs, especially those intended to build capacity of government counterparts, should factor in the time and human resources necessary to build and maintain strong relationships over\nthe life of the program.\n\n4. The program has shown that promoting long-term carbon sequestration and reduced GHG emissions is possible through an emphasis on capacity building for improved forest management\npractices; awareness campaigns on harmful impacts of deforestation and forest degradation; improved forest and carbon measurement TTMs; community programs with promise as models\nfor scaling; and private sector and donor support for awareness campaigns, forest protection, and restoration.\n\n5. An environmental program can significantly impact the lives of women and men through TTMs that provide them with income generating opportunities.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. Interventions that are linked to livelihoods showed great promise and uptake in communities. \n\n2. USAID should plan to conduct a comprehensive training needs assessment with the GOI that includes an assessment of the need for training across sectors, at different levels and for training\nof trainers.\n\n3. USAID should continue to emphasize frequent and repeated communication of project goals, activities, and approaches to GOI counterparts, especially as staff turnover occurs.\n\n4. USAID should consider scaling up and expanding focused, needs assessment-based, capacity building and awareness campaigns at all levels, targets and topics to include, for example, awareness of global carbon markets.\n\n5. Future USAID programs should continue the highly successful practice demonstrated by Forest-PLUS to consider gender when designing activities based on the particular social conditions of the state or community where activities are to be implemented.",

      "Key Findings": "Analysis of PBS results and supporting qualitative data from\nbeneficiaries and key stakeholders and review of IP documentation indicates that each of the several overarching goals and outcomes across most of the associated technical sectors were met. \n\nThere were some notable exceptions on the: poverty indicators; water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) indicators; and prevalence of underweight women. \n\nAcross the three DFAPs, greater challenges were experienced\nfor activities related to value chain development and other livelihoods/income-generating activities (IGAs), water infrastructure, and latrine building which were also reflected in the midterm evaluations for the projects. \n\nThe water and latrine issues may contribute to the smaller or negligible gains on WASH indicators that were generally observed.\n\nThe use of financial services increased during the project timeframe, but gains were smaller and the overall use of financial services among the populations within the project area was still relatively small at endline.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Overall: Future project design may consider the potential gains associated with an implementation model that aims for fewer activities and more direct beneficiaries per activity within a given community, which may in turn increase the marginal impact per household and likelihood for sustained gains across all households in a community.\n\nMCHN and WASH: FFP should consider replicating and expanding the SBCC model on MCHN interventions that emphasizes gender segregated caregiver/peer educator groups promoting positive health, nutrition, and hygiene outcomes in future DFAPs in Niger.\n\nAgriculture and Livelihoods: The package of CA techniques, improved seed varieties, and effective service delivery models (Farmer Field School, Participatory Varietal Selection) should be closely reviewed for potential scale up in future DFSA design.\n\nResilience: A strategic review of the structural factors impeding progress of the SCAP-RU to work more effectively with commune and regional government authorities should be undertaken by FFP.",

      "Key Findings": "1. MERP activities have directly and indirectly helped to reduce emissions at the municipal level.\n\n2. In the past two years, with assistance from MERP and other development partners, GOU has adopted key laws to stimulate energy efficiency in the housing and utility sector – Law on Ownership in Multi-apartment Residential Buildings; Law on Energy Efficiency of Buildings; Law on Commercial Metering, which requires meters for heat and water, and regulates billing; and Law on Housing and Communal Services.\n\n3. MERP’s assistance in the passage of key energy efficiency legislation (especially, metering, building standards, and HOAs) created a legal and regulatory climate that was much more conducive to commercial and donor investment in Energy Efficiency (EE).\n\n4. The municipalities interviewed rated MERP’s assistance highly.\n\n5. The evaluation found that MERP has successfully helped municipalities take advantage of investment opportunities offered by IFIs.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. Any future program should replicate and expand the work MERP has begun at the municipal level.\n\n2. Further donor support is needed to develop secondary legislation for recently passed laws on energy efficiency, commercial metering, and housing and communal services.\n\n3. Adopt proven and effective methodologies.\n\n4. Both key informants and focus groups brought up the need to replicate permanent energy advisory groups or “resource centers,” which could be regional, municipal, or HOA-based.\n\n5. Replicate the methodology to help more municipalities attract investments.",

Findings from the FGDs and the KIIs highlighted communities’ strong desire and willingness to sustain project activities.\n\n4. Shae Thot made notable strides to advance gender equality and inclusion of marginalized groups, most effectively through VDCs and VDFs, microfinance structures like WORTH and PGMF, and capacity building and empowerment efforts.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. Conduct a needs assessment and situational analysis in each state/region of planned implementation to thoroughly understand the contextual differences among project communities and design activities according to the most pressing community development needs. \n2. Conduct a thorough gender analysis or assessment prior to program implementation to identify the opportunities and entry points to ensure activities in all sectors holistically advance gender\nequality and target restrictive gender norms.\n3. Engage marginalized/vulnerable individuals and groups (including youth, people with disabilities, the illiterate, the very poor), during the program design stage to build early engagement and ensure planned interventions are maximally inclusive.\n4. Clearly articulate the activities within each sector and delineate how consortium partners will share and coordinate responsibilities, if multiple partners are working in the same sector and/or\ngeographic area. \n5. Consider deepening engagement with the government (or relevant non-state actors, like armed groups) at both the national and local levels, as well as with the private sector, to share knowledge and lessons learned, expand the impact of a multi-sectoral integrated approach as early as possible, and identify additional technical and financial resources to support community development activities.",

There seems to be very little duplication of work between the bilateral and the regional programs, possibly because there are only few bilateral programs in the target countries focusing on water or related activities.\n\n3. The ET found that because every water sector activity has downstream consequences, these consequences can impact American national security priorities.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. Become more focused when undertaking regional programming.\n\n2. Increased coordination and communication between the regional and bilateral program is imperative, certainly as programs are being designed, and more so when they are set to be implemented.\n\n3. Education, employment, and sustainable livelihoods are critical for youth, who make up large percentages of many MENA countries.",

      "Key Findings": "This endline assessment revealed tremendous improvement in MCSP-supported facilities between baseline and endline in the key areas supported by MCSP/RHS—availability of health workers and payment of salaries, basic equipment and supplies, basic infrastructure (e.g., wells, incinerators, triage, isolation units, and\nlatrines), service provision for essential RMNCAH interventions, and adherence to clinical standards to ensure quality of care. \n\nMOH perception of the project was also very positive.\n\nThe endline assessment results demonstrate that MCSP/RHS has remarkably restored access to and utilization of health services and has rebuilt confidence in the health systems at the facility and county levels, thereby contributing to improvements in RMNCAH outcomes in Liberia following the tremendous impact Ebola had on utilization of and confidence in the health system.\n\nThe restoration of the system is evidenced by a combination of programmatic improvements in health service delivery in MCSP-supported facilities and the positive performance of key outcome indicators over the 34 months of the project.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Despite the huge improvements in the supported health facilities, one key area that needs to be critically addressed is recurrent stock outs of essential medicines. \n\nThe gains made by MCSP/ RHS need to be sustained through transitioning of health facility staff to the government payroll; ongoing procurement and distribution of IPC supplies; and proper use and maintenance of medical equipment and waste, water, and triage features.",

      "Key Recommendations": "Recommendation 1: The design of FARMA II limited the potential for assessing the impacts of USAID’s long-term and generally well-perceived engagement in the agriculture sector. When designing new agricultural activities, lessons learned from previous programming should be integrated as early as the Request for Proposals (RFP) stage.\n\nRecommendation 2: Given the importance of a combination of TA and grants, FARMA II should prioritize the provision of direct, high-intensity, and high-quality TA to PO grantees.\n\nRecommendation 3: Since new FARMA II beneficiaries will be smaller POs, FARMA II should tailor its TA accordingly.\n\nRecommendation 4: USAID/BiH should reconsider supporting the financing of the two AgMentor physical centers.\n\nRecommendation 5: USAID/BiH should perform a thorough financial analysis to determine whether the AgMentor approach diverted financial resources away from the direct provision of TA by FARMA II personnel to beneficiaries or served as an effective multiplier of TA to the targeted sectors.",

      "Key Recommendations": "POVERTY, NUTRITION AND SCALE\n• Especially for an activity the size of KAVES, USAID should endeavor to measure indicators such as income, poverty and hunger, even if not required by FTF.\n\nMEASURING VALUE CHAINS\n• FTF value chain projects should place more focus on measuring small and medium enterprise (SME) employment development along value chains, as a high proportion of household incomes comes from off-farm activities.\n\nPARTNERSHIPS AND FINANCE\n• USAID should continue efforts to encourage aggregation, as this will bring additional income to smallholders and provide cost-effective raw product supply options for dairies, fruit processors, fresh produce exporters and breweries.\n\nPRODUCTION AND PROCESSING\n• The dairy value chain should be a continued key focus of FTF programming.",

      "Key Findings": "PHS’s quarterly and annual reports show good progress towards many of their defined indicators, but progress towards the larger IRs was not conceptualized or tracked as thoroughly as it should have been.\n\n\nPHS was successful in several areas, including in fostering relationships with the councils, in establishing SQIS protocols, in working with the medical bureaus, in providing OVC support, and in meeting their service delivery targets. \n\nThe program fell behind in lowering the prices of drugs, commodities, and services to the consumer, and in documenting progress or shortcomings towards the IRs across the life of the\nprogram. \n\nThe evaluation team found that PHS had mixed results in achieving the IRs, but the larger picture shows that PHS also struggled with the learning and adaptation needed to be able to manage the competing components as a cohesive program.",
      "Key Recommendations": "• USAID/Uganda should ensure that modifications and changes in scope are undertaken in a manner that does not fundamentally alter the theory of change (TOC) of the program.\n• Implementing Partners (IPs) should periodically pause and reflect on whether their activities and the results being achieved are in sync with their TOC and the program objectives as set out in the\ntask order, including program modifications.\n• IPs should undertake investigations (learning) during implementation intended to establish impediments to achieving results and objectives with intend to support adaptive management and decision-making, and not wait for mid and endline evaluations.\n• A CLA plan should be developed at the beginning of the program and hiring of a CLA specialist should be prioritized to ensure continuous application and integration of CLA approaches.\n• Access to financing for the private health sector requires a phased approach- PHS should first prepare smaller HCBs to better situate themselves as candidates for loans, through interventions\nsuch as HaaB trainings, business skills development, and financial management, before linking the HCBs to the banks. \n• IPs should initiate other modalities to incentivize HFs to deliver comprehensive health services and to add additional services to clients, following the cancellation of use of “performance-based\ngrants” by COP 15 guidance for Program engagement with HIV care and treatment services in the private sector.

      "Key Findings": "While KIE benefits were intended to flow down to smallholder farmers in areas with the greatest density of poverty to address FTF goals of food security and nutrition, KIE’s measurements of success were inherently contradictory: performance was measured by sales and growth of private sector companies to an impoverished population that had minimal funds, farms with economic potential, sufficient number of animals, access to markets, general education level and intellectual capacity to understand the cost/benefits of how innovators’ products could benefit them.\n\nKIE was neither designed nor implemented to directly address the needs of smallholder farmers; it was designed to identify, foster and bring to scale innovative market-driven solutions and enable innovations to become fully sustainable in the market.\n\nKIE had successful collaboration with two other OEG programs.\n\nThe majority of innovators found the technical assistance to be highly valuable.\n\nKIE may be credited with expediting innovators’ attractiveness to investors through a no-cost capital injection that enabled them to mitigate financial risk while entering challenging geographic markets and experimenting with business expansion without eroding their financial base and company valuations.",
      "Key Recommendations": "Program Objectives, Design and Indicators:\n--Establish a single identity for the project to assist management, staff and USAID to remain on track. \n\nFinancing Criteria:\n--Work with banks to devise loan products that take into account the high-risk nature of innovative agribusiness companies. \n\nUtilize Local Networks\n--Promote project and availability of support through channels as an alternative to donor networks and that will increase reach to women and youth, such as through social networks, agriculture institutes and entrepreneur networks.\n\nMonitoring Progress\n--Establish a process to monitor companies’ financial performance, progress and use of grant funds.\n\nDevelopment Objectives\n--To maximize the adoption of agriculture innovations, emphasize a rural IP presence, ensure protracted farmer contact and employ an aggressive farmer field day schedule.",

      "Key Findings": "1. An initial round of interviews with key informants and a review of USAID documents conducted to frame the research revealed there is no clear education sector definition of “education systems” or “systems strengthening”\n2. Evaluations contained limited evidence of systems strengthening. Evaluations in crisis and conflict settings (e.g., South Sudan) noted that weak systems and severe resource limitations severely affected systems strengthening opportunities.\n3. ‘Listening’ to understand the capacity of the system is critical. From the beginning, establishing a forum for dialogue, information-sharing, and decision-making that involves host governments is essential for programming success.\n4. Human capacity development without requisite institutional capacity/strengthening has limited impact.\n5. Mobility of teacher and other education staff impedes human and institutional capacity development.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. Develop a collective vision and common strategy for education systems strengthening to follow the Agency’s focus on fostering local institutional and individual capacity-building initiatives that ensure all children and youth are in school and learning. \n2. Review and validate existing and develop additional assessment instruments to evaluate education system challenges and opportunities, with a focus on improving access to education and learning outcomes.\n3. Develop an integrated strategy and approach to support the building of institutional and individual capacity for systems strengthening with a focus on improving access and learning\noutcomes.\n4. Further research is needed on the impact of education workforce recruitment, deployment, migration, and retention on USAID investments in capacity building.\n5. G2G funding in the education sector that targets systems strengthening to support improved access and learning outcomes may require its own retrospective study.",

      "Key Findings": "After 5 years of implementation, USAID FinGAP spent $22 million in U.S. Government (USG) resources from USAID, FtF, and the PFG initiative, successfully leveraging nearly $168 million in new financing to almost 3,000 agribusinesses in the maize, rice, and soy value chains. This is more than double the project’s top-line indictor of $75M in financing. USAID FinGAP additionally mobilized $91.1 million in alternate financing from the capital markets for two SMEs. USAID FinGAP is widely considered a success, not only due to the number and scale of loans placed, but because it changed the market for agricultural financing in Ghana from one where FIs were reluctant to lend to agribusinesses, to one where FIs are competing for market position in agricultural financing.",

Meanwhile, 90% of TB cases were successfully treated in USG sites by end of Year 5, equivalent to 95% of the target treatment success rate (that is, 95%) by EOP. The Project reached 50% of the Filipino population with quality TB care through a strengthened health system. Key to these achievements was the committed participation of partners at the community, local government unit (LGU), regional, and national levels in both public and private sectors.",

      "Key Recommendations": "• To mitigate the difficulties in achieving Mission buy-ins, which stem from lack of time and resources on the part of Missions (and, with respect to some Missions, such as Nepal, a lack of interest), BFS and/or Regional Bureaus could sponsor AA's for Missions with the greatest need for improvement in AET training. Need could be determined by scoping assessments.\n• Project implementers should develop ways to make more direct contacts with AET institutions to promote good AET practices.\n• Project implementers engaged in activities aimed at supporting Missions should take stock of where Feed the Future projects are in the implementation cycle to prioritize resources towards Missions during the project design phase.\n• Future implementers of similar projects should make sure that all assessments address the major gaps and shortfalls of AET institutions, and that they also address Mission priorities and strategies for building AET capacity.\n• Project implementers need to establish public outreach programs that focus on raising the awareness of Mission staff, other Feed the Future projects, and the AET institution community.",

      "Key Recommendations": "1) USAID project designs should contextualize international best practices in the local operating environment. \n\n\n2) USAID should ensure that the project design process includes a complete analysis of relevant stakeholders through a sector- specific stakeholder analysis and mapping exercise.\n\n3) USAID should directly, and not via the IP, ensure political endorsement and buy-in for projects during project implementation. \n\n4) USAID should consider more actively adjusting contract deliverables to respond to unforeseen changes in the project’s environment.\n\n5) When designing projects, both USAID and GoA should discuss mechanisms for measuring GoA engagement with the IP.",

      "Key Recommendations": "USAID should offer more programming like ABADE; productive enterprises have a huge need for M/E and such an initiative can produce real, sustainable jobs.\n\nIf precise indicator data, e.g., “jobs created,” are not available, suitable proxies should be used together with regular on-site observations, while keeping in mind limitations on data validity.\n\nM/E vendors should provide not only M/E according to specifications, but also technicians to help install and integrate the M/E into existing production lines, and train on operation and maintenance.",

      "Key Recommendations": "For any current or future similar projects, the ET strongly suggests\nthat a specific needs analysis should be conducted to identify the unique needs and challenges for each SE for targeted interventions to be developed and implemented at the pre-project design stage.\n\nTo build on the progress achieved so far, the ET recommends that any future similar projects incorporate SEBI’s enabling environment\nobjectives to ensure that social entrepreneurship remains on the\nradar in Jamaica.\n\nFor future interventions supporting SEs, special effort must be made to include local stakeholders in the rural parishes, including hosting awareness events there.\n\nBefore any such entity is contemplated all stakeholders must be consulted, including at local level in the parishes, in order to ensure that such a body is viable and sustainable and that it is aligned with the actual needs and requirements of intended beneficiaries.",

      "Key Recommendations": "For DENR to strengthen LAWIN, it has to:\n regularize the LAWIN Command Center within DENR with personnel and funding complement;\n expand the indicators in assessing and monitoring forest protection and biodiversity conservation;\n design and implement field validation sites for more accurate and reliable estimates of improvements in patrol activities, forest regeneration, GHG emission, and biodiversity conservation;\n improve data integrity with real-time data transmission from patrol teams to the Command Center;\n roll out the PES scheme to support LAWIN implementation;\n increase participation of LGUs in LAWIN; and\n mobilize state universities and colleges for IEC and M&E of LAWIN implementation.",

Future activities should continue to strengthen the capacity of government offices to lead UHEP\nimplementation.\n\n3. To ensure sustainability, future activities should strengthen the capacity of specific government offices at the RHB and C/THO to analyze, convene, and lead the dissemination and data use efforts. \n\n4. The evaluation team recommends planning timely and efficient strategies for the supply of commodities to work toward sustainability of SEUH results.",

      "Key Recommendations": "Focus on consolidating and deepening the current set of activities being implemented to maximize their potential for impact, scale, adaptation, and replication.\n\nConsolidate learning from the successes of PPE across and within countries.\n\nContinue to identify opportunities to expand the application of TMA analysis.\n\nConsider ways of increasing innovative, rigorous applications of technical approaches.\n\nContinue to promote the private sector, while ensuring balance and candor about its limitations and failures.",

      "Key Recommendations": "Strengthening Implementation Effectiveness and Sustainability:\n• CITIES should focus more on contextually nuanced and technical training than awareness raising efforts especially when targeting municipal staff and leadership.\n• To the extent possible, CITIES should tie grants to needs identified in the needs manual sanctioned by official process.\n• CITIES should support the unification of all capacity building efforts under one institutional umbrella whether it is MOMA’s training directorate or another institution to increase\nsustainability and advocate that such efforts are sequenced to ensure effectiveness and knowledge retention and application.\n\nSynergy:\n• USAID and CITIES should continue, and increasingly take an active role, to strengthen inter-donor coordination related to support for municipal services and decentralization.\n• CITIES and the next ET should support efforts to capture learning generated by the multiple donors in the same development space as CITIES, and its application.",

      "Document Title": "Model Behavior: 20 Business Model Innovations for Sustainability",
      "Key Findings": "Every exchange in a value chain provides opportunities for innovation and impact. Companies that have demonstrated a business model innovation have often done so by shifting incentives in the value chain. The largest companies tend not to be the source of new models, but they can help evolve and scale them. Lastly, business model innovation doesn’t happen in a vacuum.",
      "Key Recommendations": "1. Don’t be afraid to question existing models. The first step in building something new is having the courage to examine the current model—as business model thinker Patrick Stähler puts it, getting “all the tacit and unspoken assumptions on the table.” Challenging the dominant logic may, in fact, be the most difficult step, but it’s the only way to move towards identifying new options.\n\n2. Be willing to try something new. If companies\nare best at maintaining what they already do, recognize that any true business model innovation will require building new skills and applying different capabilities. Innovators should be\nwilling to let go of what made them successful in the past. Some experts recommend taking a “portfolio approach,” maintaining focus on what’s worked before, but dedicating some percentage of resources towards development of entirely new business models.\n\n3. Establish and protect an innovation culture. For business model innovation to succeed, some level of cultural support must be present within the company, or at least within a team responsible for innovation. This includes, but is not limited to, a mission and/ or goals that promote the pursuit of innovative business models; the right management structure allowing for discussion and connection around innovation; incentives for identifying and cultivating breakthrough innovation; and an entrepreneurial mindset, with the ability to prototype, experiment, fail fast, and learn (as with the “lean startup” model).\n",

However, 70% of current impact investment assets under management are in emerging markets and 30% in developed markets.The sample is about half fund managers (as it was last year), with foundations as the second-largest group by organization type, at 22% of respondents. Just over half of the sample (54%) principally targets “competitive, market rate returns”, with the remainder of the sample evenly split between “below market rate returns: closer to market rate” (23%) and “below market rate returns: closer to capital preservation” (23%).\n",

      "Key Findings": "The emerging findings from the available literature assist in understanding that regulatory processes include national legislation and voluntary self-regulation within firms. Evidence on the links between regulation and inclusive growth is inconsistent. Some\nregulatory efforts have had positive social impacts, but the evidence base is limited. Many interventions focus on upgrading and sharing the gains from participating in global, regional and national value chains, including linking producers to high-value markets and improving working conditions. Evidence of the impact of interventions is limited by a lack of rigorous evaluations, but there are some case study examples of success. In terms of market development, they are particularly important for poor men and women, yet they are often costly or difficult to access. Interventions aim to increase access to markets by providing new technologies and technical assistance, and by brokering links between producers and buyers.",

      "Key Recommendations": "1. Take a holistic approach to developing a gender strategy: Identify the specific gender-related risks,\nresponsibilities and opportunities that the company faces throughout its business activities and areas of influence\n(core business operations; value chain; communities; and policy dialogue) and develop an overarching strategic\nplan that leverages all of the company’s assets to address these in a comprehensive and integrated manner.\n\n2. Embed the corporate responsibility to respect women’s rights into relevant policies and standards:\nAt a minimum, aim to ‘do no harm.’ Implement policies and undertake due diligence to identify, prevent,\nmitigate and remediate human rights risks and formal discrimination against women in the company’s\nbusiness operations and value chain.\n\n3. Establish goals, incentives and programs to actively promote women’s opportunities:\nAim explicitly to create shared value through actively empowering women. Identify a small number of priority\ngoals to increase women’s participation and progress at all levels of the company’s business operations, value\nchain, communities and policy dialogue and establish time-based targets, incentives and programs to drive\nperformance and culture change.\n\n4. Create cross-functional leadership structures and champions for women’s empowerment:\nToo often, gender is addressed in corporate silos. Human resources focuses on workplace inclusion and\ndiversity; procurement on supplier diversity; community relations on community initiatives, etc. While functional\nspecialization is needed, this limits synergies and shared learning between different parts of the business.\nCreate senior corporate-level or operational-level Women’s Leadership Councils and/or identify some of\nthe most respected female and male executives across the company to act as champions for women’s\nadvancement, both internally and externally.",

In terms of investment activity and allocations and as Table 3 shows, the group reports having committed USD 10.6bn in 2014 and intends to invest 16% more – USD 12.2bn – in 2015. The region to which the highest number of respondents plan to increase their allocations is SSA (29 respondents), followed by ESE Asia (28 respondents) and LAC (27 respondents).\n\nIn terms of market development and pipeline, respondents indicated progress across the board on several key indicators of market growth, including: collaboration among investors, availability of investment opportunities, usage of impact measurement standards, and number of intermediaries with significant track record. Survey participants reported that their portfolios are performing mostly in line with both their impact expectations and financial return expectations (Figure 8).",

Is the tool usable? How should we balance usability with the technical applications of the tool? How do we engage local communities so that they can continue to use and maintain the tool over time?\n",

And while involving business isn’t a prerequisite for success, the business community’s support and expertise can greatly enhance the odds. Transformation of the education ecosystem is important to sustained improvement in education outcomes. Business leaders want to see improvements in inequality, poverty, and economic mobility, as well as a higher-skilled workforce. They also see education as both a cause of and a solution to these economic challenges, and through collective impact, they can multiply the effectiveness of their efforts.",

Exploring expert perspectives and the growing universe of multi- stakeholder initiatives, the report affirms that collaboration has become a central focus for global companies and other organizations pursuing transformative change.  At the same time, given the scope of the challenges and the inherent difficulties of collaboration, there is no guarantee that existing efforts will deliver the desired impact.  With this in mind, the report offers a vision of what the next generation of collaboration for sustainability could look like, and how would-be collaborators can help bring it about.",

      "Key Recommendations": "1. Accelerate and simplify internal knowledge sharing on RBF\n2. Reduce time and expense associated with programming, implementing RBF\n3. Promote innovation in how RBF programs are monitored and verified\n4. This agenda will benefit from convening a cross-Agency team",

      "Key Findings": "In the DRC, the occupation of the park by armed groups engaged in artisanal mining has led to unprecedented losses of eastern lowland gorillas.

Madagascar’s coastal and marine biodiversity also plays an important role in the livelihoods and food security of the country.",
      "Key Recommendations": "The applied PEA research identified three themes as indirect drivers of biodiversity loss that should be familiar by now:\n• Patronage networks, which play an important role in the illegal or unregulated acquisition of resources (e.g., fish, land, forest resources, minerals) and abuse of power leaves communities vulnerable to the above drivers;\n• Lack of accountability, which is related to failures of land use planning and security of property (armed occupation in the DRC, elites enabling dispossession of customary landholders in Uganda and lack of enforcement of existing fishing regulations and coastal zoning in Madagascar); and\n• Criminality related to wildlife trafficking and unsustainable hunting or fishing practices related to and amplified by extractive activities taking place.",

      "Key Findings": "Several themes emerge from these applied PEA case studies on biodiversity conservation and extractives in Africa. The applied PEA research identified three themes as indirect drivers of biodiversity loss that should be familiar by now:\n\n• Patronage networks, which play an important role in the illegal or unregulated acquisition of resources (e.g., fish, land, forest resources and minerals) and abuse of power leaves communities vulnerable to the above drivers;\n• Lack of accountability, which is related to failures of land use planning and security of property (armed occupation of the park in the DRC, elites enabling dispossession of customary landholders in Uganda and lack of enforcement of existing fishing regulations and coastal zoning in Madagascar); and\n• Criminality related to wildlife trafficking and unsustainable hunting or fishing practices related to and amplified by extractive activities taking place.\n",
